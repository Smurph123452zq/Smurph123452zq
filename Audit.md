# Repo Audit Notes

## Errors and Issues

- [x] Merge conflicts in [[Shattered Isles Vault File Structure.txt]] resolved.
- Many notes end with stray terminal text like `root@...` indicating truncated file saves (e.g., [[Narazir's Personal Lab]], [[Porkery Buns]]).
- Some notes use improper tag formatting without YAML frontmatter, starting with lines like `tags:`.
- Several images are JPEGs instead of PNGs (`Nagissia idea.jpg`, `World Overview/Pantheon & Deities/Ashqua.jpg`).
- [x] Directory [[Campagin Notes]] is misspelled; should be `Campaign Notes`.
- Multiple alignment notes misspell "Lawful Neutral" as "Lawful Netural" ([[Ventri Gale-Thunder]], [[Charlie]], [[Mumblebeard]]).
- Inconsistent artifact name: "Crown of Day Break" vs "Crown of Dayn Break" in [[The Final Eclipse]].
- Location note reference uses "The Quite Mountain" instead of "The Quiet Mountain" in [[Aurene Candra]].
- Numerous missing links and images reported by `scripts/auto_draft.py checklinks`.

## Missing or Incomplete Content

- [[2025-05-28 Ashqua's fall]] is one long sentence with no formatting.
- [[The Quiet Mountain]] and [[Porkery Buns]] lack descriptions beyond placeholder sections.
- [[Unwritten]] briefly mentions corruption but has no details.
- Many creature stat blocks reference missing PNGs.
