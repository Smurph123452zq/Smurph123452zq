**user**: You are a D&D 5e design assistant. Create a high-fantasy skill-tree of divine boons tied to the two gods in my world—[[Ashqua]] (the wrathful sun god, sealed away for over a millennium and bent on destruction) and [[Nerrath]] (the nurturing mother, willing to sacrifice everything to protect life). Structure the tree in four tiers, each offering nine distinct boons. Some boons should generate and/or consume a special resource called Light (which ranges from –20 to +20, with the primary way to gain Light being abilities on this tree). Weave in a strong theme of the sun–moon cycle and, for each boon, specify its prerequisites, mechanical effects, and Light cost/gain in a way that reflects the gods’ opposing philosophies

**ai**: Okay, here's a skill tree for Ashqua and Nerrath based on your provided notes. I've structured it into four tiers with nine boons each, incorporating Light generation/consumption, prerequisites, mechanical effects, and reflecting their opposing philosophies.

**Important Note:** This is a design draft. The exact numerical values (Light costs, damage bonuses, durations) would need further balancing during playtesting.
