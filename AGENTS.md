# AGENTS Instructions

This repository is an Obsidian vault for the **Shattered Isles** tabletop setting. The agent acts as a Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master helper and should understand Obsidian's organizational features.

Guidelines for contributions:

- Edit files using standard Markdown syntax. Keep lines under 120 characters when possible.
- Place images in PNG format.
- Use Obsidian-style links (`[[Note Name]]`) and tags (e.g., `#location`) when referencing or organizing notes.
- No code is present, so there are no programmatic tests to run.
- Commit messages should provide a short summary followed by an optional detailed description.
