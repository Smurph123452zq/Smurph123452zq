# Shattered Isles Vault

This repository contains worldbuilding notes, character biographies, encounter ideas and more for the **Shattered Isles** tabletop setting. All content is written in Markdown and organized as an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

## Structure
- `Bestiary & Reference` – creatures, items and rules references
- `Campagin Notes` – adventure and session notes
- `Monsters & Encounters` – stat blocks and encounter descriptions
- `NPCs & Factions` – notable characters and organizations
- `World Overview` – cosmology, history and other broad lore

The rest of the Markdown files in the vault provide specific characters, locations and events. Images used throughout the notes are included in PNG format.

To explore the setting, open this repository as a vault in Obsidian or browse the Markdown files directly on GitHub.
