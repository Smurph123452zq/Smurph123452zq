Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.\n- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated \"dragon paths\" through the settlements.\n- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463107803,"nchars":1409},"41":{"title":"The Root & Vine","path":"World Overview/Setting & Cosmology/Geography/Gealaí Enclave/Islands/Críoch Skolvar/Towns/Magda/The Root & Vine.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762815,"mtime":1746383400353,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/04 14:30:00"},"id":"e27ff10479f288d8eebc232935829aa5","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Root & Vine]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/04 14:30:00\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, relevant, keywords/short, phrases, tags, provided, note:, 1., Magda, (Location), 2., Herbal, Teas, 3., Old, Man, Hemlock, 4., Glimmering, Grotto, 5., Dragonvine, Decor, 6., Zonnewij, Isels, 7., Stone, Fireplace\n\n**Description:** A cozy, dimly lit inn nestled within the cave systems of [[Magda]], renowned for its calming atmosphere and extensive selection of herbal teas brewed from locally-sourced cave flora.

The Nature of the Agitation:** Instead of simply stating dragons are agitated, Brynjar should describe _how_ they're behaving differently. She could mention:\n\n- “Their usual playful curiosity has turned to…restlessness. A frantic energy I haven’t witnessed in centuries.”\n- \"They seem disturbed by something deep within the earth itself – a tremor that resonates not just physically, but...spiritually.\"\n- She might note they are exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of dragons affected by ancient curses or corrupted energies (drawing on lore from [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md) and [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md)).\n\n**2. Linking to Natural Energies & Lorekeeper Concerns:** Brynjar should emphasize the connection between dragon behavior and Magda’s natural energies, referencing her role as a Lorekeeper:\n\n- “As Lorekeepers, we monitor the flow of energy within Magda. Lately, that flow has become…turbulent. The dragons are sensitive to these shifts.”\n- She could mention studying the [Vein of Azurite](app://obsidian.md/Vein%20of%20Azurite) and noticing unusual fluctuations coinciding with the dragon’s agitation. This subtly introduces a key location and potential source of corruption.\n\n**3. Hints of Moonfall & Deeper Disturbances:** Brynjar can express concern about the long-term effects of [Moonfall](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FMoonfall.md), linking it to the current unrest:\n\n- “Since the debris from [Moonfall](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FMoonfall.md) fell, we’ve observed a…fragility in the ecosystem. A vulnerability that seems to be attracting something _unnatural_.”\n- She might mention reports of unusual creatures emerging from deeper tunnels (as noted in [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md)) and express worry they are connected to the disturbances.\n\n**4. Subtle Clues & Foreshadowing:**\n\n- Brynjar could show the party a piece of corrupted flora found near an agitated dragon, hinting at a spreading influence.\n- She might mention a disturbing dream or vision she experienced, referencing unsettling imagery related to darkness and imprisonment (a subtle nod to Ashqua).\n- When discussing the dragons’ distress, Brynjar can express concern about a growing “shadow” over Magda, subtly foreshadowing Ashqua's awakening.\n\n**5. The Task & Initial Investigation:** Brynjar should task the party with investigating the dragon farms and initial cave entrances (as outlined in [Outline](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FOutline.md)), specifically asking them to:\n\n- Observe the dragons’ behavior closely.\n- Look for any signs of unusual energy or corruption.\n- Report back immediately if they find anything concerning.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, we can establish a sense of unease and foreshadow the larger threats lurking beneath Magda, setting the stage for the campaign's unfolding mysteries while leveraging the detailed lore provided in the notes.\n\n\n\n\n##TLDR :P\n*   Brynjar should describe *how* dragons are agitated, beyond simply stating they are, mentioning restlessness, spiritual disturbance, or behaviors linked to ancient curses.\n*   The agitation is connected to fluctuations in Magda’s natural energies, which Brynjar monitors as a Lorekeeper; the Vein of Azurite shows unusual activity.\n*   Moonfall has created ecosystem fragility and vulnerability, potentially attracting something unnatural and leading to reports of new creatures.\n*   Subtle clues like corrupted flora, disturbing dreams/visions, and concern about a growing “shadow” foreshadow deeper threats (like Ashqua).\n*   The party is tasked with investigating dragon farms and cave entrances, observing for unusual energy or corruption and reporting back immediately.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463107810,"nchars":4024},"47":{"title":"Dragons of Magda","path":"World Overview/Setting & Cosmology/Geography/Gealaí Enclave/Islands/Críoch Skolvar/Towns/Magda/Dragons of Magda.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1746385740186,"mtime":1746387107365,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/05/04 15:09:00","modified":"2025/05/04 15:31:47"},"id":"52aa0bbfc93c9df3de290cfc4958b1d5","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Dragons of Magda]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/05/04 15:09:00\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/04 15:31:47\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n**1.

The town is built around natural hot springs that are believed to have special powers, especially for those with dragon blood.\n\nThe buildings in Brigid use smooth stones and flowing water, making the town peaceful and respectful. It's a busy trading center where goods are exchanged with other islands. However, most people come to Brigid because of the healing springs. You’ll see lots of boats in the harbor and buildings close together that were designed based on the moon. There are also many people who work hard to protect old stories about dragons.\n\nThe town is known for its “Dragon Healers,” people who understand how to use the spring's energy to heal others. Some say the goddess [[Nerrath]] blessed these waters a long time ago, giving them special magic. \n\nBrigid is located in an area called [[Críoch Skolvar]], \"The Border of the Fallen.\" The town got its name from a Celtic goddess who was known for healing and craftsmanship. Long ago, followers of [[Nerrath]] came to this place looking for peace near the springs. Later, people wounded during wars came here too. \n\n**Demographics:**\n\n- **Population:** Approximately 450 inhabitants\n- **Races:** Predominantly Human (70%), with notable populations of Half-Elves (15%) drawn to the area’s natural beauty and restorative energies, and a small number of Dragonborn (10%) who maintain ties to ancient dragon lore. The remaining 5% are comprised of various other races.\n- **Alignment:** Generally [[Neutral Good]] – residents prioritize community well-being and peaceful coexistence.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n- **[[The Healing Springs]]:** Located just outside town, these naturally occurring springs are renowned for their restorative properties. They’re said to be blessed by [[Nerrath]] herself, capable of mending even grievous wounds.\n- **[[Brigid's Hearth]]:** The central marketplace and gathering place, named after the goddess Brigid. It features stalls selling local crafts, medicinal herbs, and fresh produce.\n- **[[The Stone Watchtower]]:** A weathered stone tower overlooking the coast, providing a vantage point for spotting incoming ships or potential threats.\n- **[[The Lunar Shrine]]:** A small shrine dedicated to [[Nerrath]] where locals offer prayers and seek guidance. It’s maintained by [[Sister Elowen]] (see Important NPCs).\n- **[[Blacksmith's Forge]]:** Run by [[Master Torvin]], known for crafting exceptional weapons and tools using ore sourced from nearby islands.\n\n**Important NPCs:**\n\n- **[[Sister Elowen]]:** A devout follower of [[Nerrath]], she tends to [[The Lunar Shrine]] and provides healing services to the community. She possesses a deep understanding of local lore and is often sought for advice.\n- **[[Master Torvin]]:** A gruff but skilled blacksmith, renowned for his craftsmanship. He’s known to be secretive about his techniques, passed down through generations.\n- **[[Old Man Hemlock]]:** An eccentric herbalist who lives on the outskirts of town. He possesses extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and is rumored to have connections to ancient dragon lore.\n- **[[Captain Valeria]]:** The captain of the local guard, responsible for maintaining order and protecting [[Brigid]] from threats. She’s a pragmatic leader with a strong sense of duty.\n\n**Economy and Trade:**\n\n- **Primary Industries:** Fishing, crafting (blacksmithing, weaving, herbalism), healing services.\n- **Trade Goods:** Medicinal herbs, crafted weapons and tools, woven textiles, fresh fish, and spring water bottled for sale to travelers.\n- **Trading Partners:** [Ayula.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Ayula.md), [Kinnan.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Kinnan.md), and occasional traders from the [Gealaí Enclave.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Geala%C3%AD%20Enclave.md). Brigid also trades with passing ships seeking restorative waters.\n\n**Local Rumors and Conflicts:**\n\n- **The Whispers of Ashqua:** Some locals claim to hear whispers on the wind, believed to be remnants of [Ashqua.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Ashqua.md)’s influence seeping into the region. They fear a resurgence of darkness.\n- **Dragonborn Discontent:** A small faction of Dragonborn in Brigid believes that the town is not doing enough to honor their ancestors and preserve dragon lore. This has led to tensions with other residents.\n- **The Missing Fishermen:** Several fishermen have gone missing at sea, sparking rumors of a monstrous creature lurking beneath the waves. Captain Valeria is investigating but has found no conclusive evidence.\n- **Smuggler Activity:** There are whispers of smugglers using Brigid as a port for illicit goods, taking advantage of its remote location and lax security.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463108471,"nchars":4960},"51":{"title":"Ayula","path":"World Overview/Setting & Cosmology/Geography/Gealaí Enclave/Islands/Críoch Skolvar/Towns/Ayula.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762521,"mtime":1746735693086,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 16:21:33"},"id":"8d191b56c0004917c10c4b1cc2168b6d","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Ayula]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 16:21:33\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n![[ayula.png]]\n\nAyula is built around ancient ruins – remnants of a pre-Shattering civilization.

Before her sacrifice, she wore robes of flowing midnight blue, embroidered with constellations that shifted like the night sky.\n\nWip appearance image\n![[Nagissia idea.jpg]]\n## Personality\n\nOnce a warm and nurturing ruler, Nerrath grew sorrowful and distant after the war against [[Ashqua]]. She is wise, reserved, and fiercely protective of balance, but her compassion remains.

These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.\n- **Oath of Redemption Paladin**: The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers. While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.\n## History\n\nNerrath ascended alongside her sister, [[Ashqua]], thanks to the aid of the [[Unwritten]]. As ruler of the Night Kingdom, she maintained the balance between day and night. However, as [[Ashqua]] descended into tyranny, Nerrath fought to preserve the world's equilibrium, leading to [[The Eclipse Wars]]**.\n\nDuring the War of the Infinite Eclipse, Nerrath fought against her sister, [[Ashqua]], to restore balance. After [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] fall, Nerrath agreed to the **United Mortal Pact**, a solemn agreement between her, the ancient dragons, and the mortals.\n## Relationships\n\n- **[[Ashqua]] (Sister, Goddess of the Sun):** Once beloved, now a fallen adversary sealed away.\n    \n- **The [[Unwritten]]:** Aiding force in her ascension, but now silent.\n    \n- **The [[Lunar Court]]:** A group of devoted followers who seek to maintain her legacy.\n## Trivia\n\n- It is said that when the moon is at its fullest, Nerrath’s whispers can be heard in the wind.\n\n- Her scattered essence manifests as luminous, ghostly figures known as Moon Shades.\n\n- Some believe that if [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] seal weakens, Nerrath’s power will return in full.\n\n\n\n## **The Lost Fragments of Nerrath**\n\nThough her body was gone, **Nerrath was not truly dead.**\n\nHer essence **was divided into five sacred relics**, each containing a part of her divine power:\n\n- **The Eyes of Nerrath** – Granting foresight and the ability to see into the dreams of mortals.\n- **The Mouth of Nerrath** – A voice of prophecy, speaking forgotten truths.\n- **The Heart of Nerrath** – A beacon of balance, pulsing with lunar power.\n- **The Body of Nerrath** – An unbreakable vessel, containing the strength of her divine will.\n- **The Head of Nerrath** – Holding the last fragments of her godly intellect and wisdom.\n\nEach piece is **an artifact of immense power**, but together, they hold an even greater secret: **if all five are found, Nerrath could return.** She would no longer be bound to the divine realm.

Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.\n- **Oathbreaker**: An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.\n## History\n\nBorn a mortal, Ashqua ascended to godhood alongside her sister, [[Nerrath]], with the aid of the enigmatic [[Unwritten]]. As ruler of the Day Kingdom, she ensured prosperity and warmth, but was ultimately deceived by a High Priestess who sought to unlock forbidden primordial power.\n\nBlinded by ambition and fear, Ashqua was consumed by an entity of pure fire, transforming into the tyrannical goddess she is today. She waged war against her sister, refusing to let the sun set, plunging the world into **[[The Eclipse Wars]]**. In the ensuing war, the land was shattered, giving rise to the scattered isles that exist today.\n\nAfter the devastating War of [[The Eclipse Wars]], Ashqua was sealed away in the center of the Dyson Sphere. This was achieved through the United Mortal Pact, an agreement between [[Nerrath]], the ancient dragons, and the mortals.\n\n## Relationships\n\n- **[[Nerrath]] (Sister, Goddess of the Moon):** Once her closest companion, now her eternal rival.\n- **The High Priestess [[Ayzat]]:** A manipulative figure who led Ashqua down her dark path.\n- **The [[Unwritten]]:** Mysterious off world beings who aided in her apotheosis but have since become her enemy.\n## Trivia\n\n- Ashqua was once known for her golden laughter, which could brighten the darkest days. Now, her voice is like crackling flame.\n- Her followers believe that one day, she will burn away all impurity, leaving only her light behind.\n\n\n\n### Intentions\n\nWhen **Ashqua ascended to godhood**, she glimpsed the greater fabric of reality, the unseen forces shaping existence. She saw that the **Shattered Isles were never meant to persist.** Their story was supposed to end, their fate written in the stars. Yet something **unnatural** kept them lingering—**The Unwritten.**\n\nThese formless, discarded ideas, half-told stories, and broken fates had taken root, corrupting reality itself. The world **refused to die**, its final chapter left unfinished. And in doing so, it had become a **cancer upon the multiverse.**\n\nOnly **she** could fix it. Only **fire** could cleanse it.\n\nAshqua did not seek conquest—she sought **destruction.** Not out of malice, but **mercy.** The Shattered Isles had to burn, their story wiped clean so that the Unwritten’s influence would not spread. If she did nothing, the **infection would fester**, consuming the rest of existence in **false stories, unfulfilled endings, and endless stagnation.**\n\nBut **Nerrath did not understand.**\n\nHer sister, bound by mortal love and duty, still clung to the world—to its people, its history, its future. **She could not accept that the Shattered Isles were a mistake.** She could not bear the weight of the knowledge Ashqua had seen.\n\nAnd so, she stood in the way.\n\n## Related Notes\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463108476,"nchars":5687},"59":{"title":"Iheen","path":"World Overview/Pantheon & Deities/Iheen.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762555,"mtime":1746738611633,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 17:10:11"},"id":"21a5d0ec1436e8df1cdcece695ed124d","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Iheen]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:10:11\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, keywords/phrases, extracted, text, suitable, tagging:, **Iheen**, **Multiverse, Library**, **Worlds, Books**, **Vandalized, Books**, **The, Tale, Shattering**, **Moonfall**\n\nOvergod of the Multiverse\nGrand Librarian Iheen store all worlds as books on the shelves of his library\nsome books have been turing up vandalized\n\n## Related Notes\n- [[Iheen's Grand Library]]\n- [[Unwritten]]\n- [[Ashqua]]\n- [[The Final Eclipse]]\n\n## Backlinks\n- [[Iheen's Grand Library]]\n- [[Unwritten]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463108478,"nchars":611},"60":{"title":"Moonfall","path":"World Overview/History & Timeline/Moonfall.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762572,"mtime":1746739229796,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 17:20:29"},"id":"cc8b7be5f8b9c3b65b6847978df3e9b8","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Moonfall]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:20:29\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, keywords/short, phrases, extracted, text, suitable, tags:, 1., Crown, Day, Break, 2., Moon, Crash, 3., New, Solar, Republic, 4., Moonlight, Monarchy, 5., Primal, Energy, Corruption, 6., Zonnewij, Isels, 7., Celestial, Imbalance\n\n## Date\n\nUnknown, but in the current era\n\n## Summary\n\nThe [[Crown of Day Break]] was accidentally activated, causing the moon to crash into the land.

Light\r\n\r\nIn the beginning, the world was ruled by two Kingdoms, each governing one half of existence. The  Queen of the Day, a benevolent ruler, commanded the sun’s warmth and light, while the Queen of Night guided the moon, bringing cool serenity and rest. Their shared rule maintained harmony, ensuring balance between day and night.\r\n\r\nYet, hidden within their kingdoms, ancient cults whispered of forbidden powers—primordial beings long sealed away, the true sources of the royal sisters' strength.\r\n\r\nThrough deception and manipulation, the High Priestess of this cult rose to become the Day Queen’s most trusted advisor. She stoked the queen’s fears, urging her to see the Night Princess not as a sister but as a threat. Slowly, the queen hardened, turning from a kind ruler into a tyrant. Eventually, she refused to let the sun set, casting the world into an unending day. Thus began the war—[[The Eclipse Wars]].\r\n\r\nSeeing what she had become, the Night Princess pleaded with her to end the conflict. But she only laughed, dismissing her as a fool. _\"The world belongs to me. Without my light, they would all perish. I do not need your dreams any longer.\"_ And with that, the High Priestess shattered an ancient stone tablet breaking the seal on the primal powers of [[Light]], unleashing a being of pure fire—the true source of the Sun’s power.\r\n\r\nThe entity consumed the Solar Empress, reshaping her into a monstrous form: a goddess of flame, with molten skin and hair like living fire. The sun flared higher, scorching the land as her fallen warriors rose anew—no longer human, but [[Molten]] husks bound to her will.\r\n\r\nThe Lunar armies, despite their resolve, were overwhelmed. The Night Princess, gravely wounded, collapsed, prepared to accept her end. But as she lay dying, another voice called out—deep, cold, and ancient. The seal that had long bound the primordial Night had also been broken.\r\n\r\nDesperate, the Night Princess surrendered herself to the darkness. Shadows and ice enveloped her form, forging her body anew—black as the void, armored in jagged frost. The moon swelled, its light dimming the sun’s blaze, and a thick, cold mist blanketed the battlefield.\r\n\r\nFrom this fog, the first [[Shade]] emerged—the spirits of fallen Lunar warriors, their bodies frozen over, their forms half-shadow and half-ice. Reinvigorated, they rose to fight once more.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, the battle raged. The land itself shattered beneath the warring gods, breaking into scattered isles adrift in the void. The war is forgotten by most, but its scars remain. This is the true origin of light and darkness, the eternal struggle between sun and moon.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n- [[Ayzat]]\r\n- [[Lunar Dominion]]\r\n- [[Molten]]\r\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]\r\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109113,"nchars":3110},"66":{"title":"The Quiet Mountain","path":"The Quiet Mountain.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762814,"mtime":1743340101674,"tags":["#character","#DND"],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"75497ccf90ed2dcef5a4c7140c9aa956","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Quiet Mountain]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #character, #DND, cities, towns, timeline, campaign, notes\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ayula]]\r\n- [[Kinnan]]\r\n- [[Galazeth]]\r\n- [[Avadbo]]\r\n- [[Charlie]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Narazir]]\r\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109114,"nchars":354},"67":{"title":"The Lunar Pact","path":"The Lunar Pact.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762812,"mtime":1743340101670,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"87b40fe052b9f8d461c48f06ec7f10ae","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Lunar Pact]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, relevant, keywords/phrases, tags:, 1., Eclipse, Wars, 2., Ashqua, 3., Dyson, Sphere, 4., Luna, Pact, 5., Nerrath, 6., Ancient, Dragons, 7., Primal, Powers\r\n\r\nAfter the devastating [[The Eclipse Wars]], [[Ashqua]] was sealed away in the center of the Dyson Sphere.

[[Ashqua]]’s fire had consumed the land, [[Nerrath]]’s frost had swallowed the sky, and the battlefield stood divided between searing radiance and unyielding night. The sisters, once bound by love, now faced each other as opposing forces in a war of gods.\r\n\r\nBut only one of them understood the **true stakes.**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]], crowned in fire, stood at the precipice of revelation. She had seen the truth—the world **was meant to end.** [[The Shattered Isles]], the war, the suffering—all of it should have faded into oblivion. Yet something held it together, defying fate itself. **The [[Unwritten]].**\r\n\r\n\"This world is a wound in the fabric of existence,\" [[Ashqua]] declared, her **[[Crown of Day Break]]** blazing like a second sun. \"It refuses to die. It lingers. It festers. If I do not burn it away, the corruption will spread beyond our world—to the very heart of the multiverse.\"\r\n\r\nBut [[Nerrath]] would not accept this. \"Perhaps the world was meant to end,\" she admitted.\r\n\"You would see them suffer for eternity,\" [[Ashqua]] said, voice heavy with sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong,\" [[Nerrath]] whispered. \"This tale is not finished it still lives. And as long as it does, I will protect it.\"\r\n\r\nThere would be no compromise.\r\n\r\nAnd so, they fought.\r\n\r\n## **The Eclipse Forms**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]] unleashed **[[Solar Dominion]]**, summoning a storm of divine fire. The battlefield erupted in molten fury the sky splitting as burning lances rained down like falling stars. Each step she took drove the sun closer, her presence warping time itself, threatening to lock the world in a moment of endless, unbearable day.\r\n\r\nBut [[Nerrath]] countered with [[Frozen Moonlight]] She froze the falling meteors in the air, shattering them into shimmering dust. With a whisper, she called upon the **[[Veil of Night]]**, swallowing the battlefield in an unnatural darkness that ate away at [[Ashqua]]’s light, a void that even the sun could not pierce.\r\n\r\nYet **[[Ashqua]] did not falter.**\r\n\r\nShe raised the **[[Blade of the Solar Flare]]** and struck—not at [[Nerrath]], but at **reality itself.** The sheer force of the blow **tore open the sky**, fire spilling into the void, turning night into a blinding inferno. **The [[Veil of Night]] burned away**, the moon itself **wounded** by the force of the strike.\r\n\r\nThe land itself became a battlefield of extremes—**one half molten, the other frozen in eternal ice.**\r\n\r\n\r\n## **The Truth Revealed**\r\n\r\nAs they fought, **[[Nerrath]] saw glimpses of her sister’s vision**—of a world that had already ended, of a fate left unfinished. She saw the Unwritten, whispering in the spaces between stories, lurking in the cracks of reality.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, she hesitated.\r\n\r\n**What if [[Ashqua]] was right?**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]] seized the moment. With the last of her strength, she called upon **[[Eternal Day]]**, pouring every last ember of her divinity into a final, devastating act. The **sun itself flared**, its light becoming an all-consuming fire that would **wipe [[The Shattered Isles]] from existence.**\r\n\r\nBut [[Nerrath]] could not let go.\r\n\r\nShe **drew upon the last of her [[Lunar Dominion]], not to strike, but to sever.**\r\n\r\nShe slipped between the threads of fate, stepping beyond time, beyond the battlefield, into the space **between moments.** And there, in that frozen instant, she reached out **and severed [[Ashqua]]’s connection to the Crown.**\r\n\r\nThe effect was **instantaneous.**\r\n\r\nThe fire dimmed. The sun wavered. **For the first time since the war began, the world saw the return of night.**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]] staggered, eyes wide in disbelief. The [[Crown of Dayn Break]], still upon her brow, **dimmed and cracked**, its once-uncontested power slipping from her grasp.\r\n\r\n[[Nerrath]] **had won.**\r\n\r\nBut the cost would be great.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **The Price of Victory**\r\n\r\nWith the last of her strength, **[[Nerrath]] reached into the unraveling power of the Crown**, repurposing its energy. No longer would it be a weapon of fire—**it would become a seal.**\r\n\r\nShe **cast [[Ashqua]] into the heart of the sun**, binding her within a prison of her own making. The sun flared one last time, then **dimmed, its overwhelming radiance fading to a warm glow.**\r\n\r\nThe war was over.\r\n\r\nBut **the backlash from the spell was catastrophic.**\r\n\r\n[[Nerrath]]’s physical form **was obliterated**, her divine essence **torn apart and scattered across the [[Bad Lands]].** She had saved the world, but she **could no longer walk upon it.**\r\nAnd so, the world moved forward. The Lunar Court rose to safeguard her memory. [[The Shattered Isles]] began to heal.\r\n\r\nBut deep within the sun, **[[Ashqua]] still burns.**\r\n\r\nShe waits.\r\n\r\nNot for vengeance. Not for conquest.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment when **the world realizes she was right all along.**\r\n\r\nFor the day when [[The Shattered Isles]] **must finally meet their end.**\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Ayzat]]\r\n- [[Iheen's Grand Library]]\r\n- [[Iheen]]\r\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]\r\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109115,"nchars":5391},"69":{"title":"The Eclipse Wars","path":"The Eclipse Wars.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762809,"mtime":1743340101676,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"34dff981ddf1ab4f5ee7db6ff67b49c5","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Eclipse Wars]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, relevant, keywords/short, phrases, provided, text:, 1., **Shattered, Isles**:, primary, battleground., 2., **Molten**:, Ashqua’s, radiant, armies., 3., **Shade**:, Nerrath’s, spectral, warriors., 4., **Lunar, Dominion**:, Nerrath's, calming, force/power., 5., **Dyson, Sphere**:, Ashqua’s, prison., 6., **Moon, Shades**:, essence, Nerrath., 7., **Eclipse, Wars**:, Marks, end, era, reminder, conflict.\r\n\r\nThe war raged on, each side pushing the other to the brink. The land itself became a canvas of destruction: rivers of fire, jagged mountains of ice, and skies illuminated by the conflicting might of day and night. The mortals, caught in the crossfire, sought refuge, only to find themselves enslaved by the warring powers.\r\n\r\n[[The Lunar Pact]]\r\nAs the conflict escalated, [[Nerrath]] saw the true cost of her fight. [[Ashqua]]'s paranoia had not only consumed her but also threatened to destroy everything else. The ancient dragons, once wise stewards of the world, made a choice: they sacrificed their intellect, becoming beasts of war. Mortals, desperate for survival, bound themselves to primal powers, giving them the strength to oppose the godswars.\r\n\r\nIn this time of desperation, [[The Lunar Pact]] was forged—a fragile alliance between Nerrath, the dragons, and mortals. Together, they sought to end the war before it consumed everything.\r\n\r\n[[The Final Eclipse]]\r\nThe battle for [[The Shattered Isles]] reached its zenith. [[Ashqua]]'s [[Molten]] armies clashed with [[Nerrath]]'s [[Shade]]—spectral warriors of ice and shadow. The battlefield was a stark contrast: the [[Molten]], radiant and fierce, against the [[Shade]]s, ethereal and cold, their presence sapping heat from the earth.\r\n\r\n[[Nerrath]] led the charge, her [[Lunar Dominion]] a calming force amidst the flames. She moved with grace, her mind guided by the stars, seeking to restore balance. Yet [[Ashqua]], consumed by fear, would not relent. The war raged on, each side pushing the other to the brink of collapse.\r\n\r\nIn a climactic clash, [[Nerrath]] confronted [[Ashqua]], her [[Lunar Dominion]] flaring with cold light. The conflict was not just physical but emotional—a battle of wills, where each sister fought for what they believed was right.\r\n\r\nThe Tragic Victory\r\n[[Ashqua]]'s fear of losing control led her to a dark truth: this world must burn. \r\nYet Nerrath's unwavering resolve shone brighter than Ashqua's tyranny. In their final encounter, Nerrath sacrifices herself to weaken Ashqua's hold, her essence scattering across the Badlands as Moon Shades—a haunting reminder of her strength.\r\n\r\nThe war ended with a bittersweet truce. The Lunar Pact sealed Ashqua away within the Dyson Sphere, her godly might trapped but not destroyed. Nerrath's sacrifice bought the world a temporary peace, though it came at great cost.\r\n\r\nThe Aftermath\r\nThe Shattered Isles lay in ruins, their landscapes scarred by the war's aftermath. The Lunar Court emerged, carrying Nerrath's legacy, determined to protect balance. Ashqua, imprisoned, became a fearsome legend—a tale of cautionary tales about the dangers of unchecked power.\r\n\r\nYet the world was changed forever. The mortals, bound by the Lunar Pact, learned the true weight of their actions. They carried the scars of war, not just in their land but in their hearts, forever remembering the sisters who gave everything for a chance at peace.\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse Wars marked the end of an era, leaving behind a world on the edge of rebuilding. The Shattered Isles would one day rise again, but the lessons of that war would linger, a reminder of the thin line between light and shadow.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n- [[The Lunar Pact]]\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]\r\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109116,"nchars":3968},"70":{"title":"The Dragon’s Rest","path":"The Dragon’s Rest.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762808,"mtime":1743340101690,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"cf7c0a58d7a9d14f3c0962cf73938cd2","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Dragon’s Rest]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: dragon, keepers, tavern, dragonscale, decor, Stonehelm, Dragon, Breath, Ale, storytelling, dragon, farms.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Description:** A boisterous, warm tavern favored by dragon keepers, ranchers, and those who appreciate a strong drink and lively conversation.

He’s known for his strong ales and even stronger opinions on proper dragon care.\r\n\r\n**Ambiance & Features:**\r\n\r\n*   **Dragonscale Decor:** The tavern is filled with dragon-related artifacts, creating a unique atmosphere.\r\n*   **Roaring Fireplace:** A massive fireplace dominates one wall, providing warmth and a gathering point for patrons.\r\n*   **Sturdy Tables & Benches:** Built to withstand the roughhousing of dragon keepers and adventurers.\r\n*   **Dragon Breath Ale:** The house specialty – a potent ale brewed with herbs said to mimic the effects of dragon breath (warming and invigorating).\r\n*   **Storytelling Nights:** Every week, patrons share tales of their encounters with dragons, both tame and wild.\r\n\r\n**Menu (Sample):**\r\n\r\n| Item                | Price (Shards) | Description                                      |\r\n| ------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\r\n| Dragon Breath Ale    | 4              | Strong ale with a warming effect.                 |\r\n| Smoked Dragon Sausage | 5              | Savory sausage made from dragon-fed livestock.     |\r\n| Stonehelm’s Stew      | 3              | Hearty stew with root vegetables and spiced meat.  |\r\n| Scalebread           | 2              | Crusty bread baked with dragonscale flour (rumored). |\r\n\r\n**Notable Patrons:**\r\n\r\n*   [[Torvin Stonebeard]], the Cave Warden Captain, is a regular, often seen discussing cave safety with dragon keepers.\r\n*   Dragonborn ranchers frequently gather here to share information and trade stories.\r\n*   Adventurers seeking contracts related to dragon farming or protection sometimes frequent the tavern.\r\n\r\n**Rumors & Lore:**\r\n\r\n*   Borin “Scale-Hand” Stonehelm lost his original hand in an encounter with a rogue dragon, but now considers it a badge of honor.\r\n*   Some say Borin has secret knowledge about the ancient dragon nesting sites within the caves.\r\n*   A hidden back room is rumored to be used for illegal dragon scale trading.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Establishments of Interest in Magda]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Establishments of Interest in Magda]]\r\n- [[Magda]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109117,"nchars":3140},"71":{"title":"Stonecarvers’ Guild","path":"Stonecarvers’ Guild.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762807,"mtime":1743340101674,"tags":["#character","#DND"],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"723ab9988b6de048957c58be2c6f5a2d","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Stonecarvers’ Guild]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #character, #DND, cities, towns, timeline, campaign, events\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ayula]]\r\n- [[Kinnan]]\r\n- [[Galazeth]]\r\n- [[Avadbo]]\r\n- [[Charlie]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[2025-03-27]]\r\n- [[Magda]]\r\n- [[Stone Wardens]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109118,"nchars":366},"72":{"title":"Stone Wardens","path":"Stone Wardens.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762805,"mtime":1743340101690,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"e4e3a566776a2de4777d6329fa762585","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Stone Wardens]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, keywords/short, phrases, extracted, tags:, 1., Cave, Systems, 2., Structural, Integrity, 3., Communal, Living, 4., Stoneworking, 5., Geology, 6., Tunnel, Network, 7., Energy, Fluctuations\r\n\r\n**Role & Responsibilities:** The [[Stone Wardens]] are responsible for maintaining the cave systems of [[Magda]], ensuring structural integrity and safety.

Forged from **shadow, frost, and the lingering essence of the fallen**, they exist as a counterforce to [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] blazing [[Molten]]. Neither living nor truly dead, they are spectral remnants, **cloaked in cold mist and bound by an undying will to fight**.\r\n\r\n### **Transformation and Creation**\r\n\r\nUnlike the [[Molten]], who are consumed by fire and corruption, Shades are created through **[[Nerrath|Nerrath's]] embrace of darkness and ice**. The process is not one of slow decay but **a violent resurgence**—a soul called back from death, reshaped into something both haunting and unnatural.\r\n\r\n- **Death and Rebirth** – When a warrior falls under the moon’s gaze, their lingering spirit is drawn into the cold mist. If they are deemed worthy, ice and shadow knit them back together.\r\n- **Body of Frost and Void** – Shades are no longer bound by flesh. Their forms are **half-substantial**, shifting between **frozen armor and spectral mist**, their bodies always on the edge of dissolving into shadow.\r\n- **Mind of Echoes** – Shades retain fragments of their former selves, but their emotions are dulled, their thoughts distant whispers. They exist for one purpose: to oppose the Molten and maintain balance in the eternal war of fire and ice.\r\n\r\n### **Physical Appearance**\r\n\r\nShades vary in form, shaped by the strength of their spirit and the depth of their connection to [[Nerrath]]. Some still resemble **armored warriors**, their bodies rimed with frost, while others **have lost all shape**, appearing only as shifting, jagged silhouettes of shadow and cold.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient among them are **nothing but void and frost**, faceless specters with glowing, ice-blue eyes—**ghosts of a war that never truly ended**.\r\n\r\n### **Types of Shades**\r\n\r\n- **[[Mistborn Stalkers]]** – Fast-moving hunters that flicker in and out of sight, striking from the fog before vanishing again.\r\n- **[[Frostbound Husks]]** – Heavy, armored Shades with jagged ice blades. Their presence saps the warmth from the air, freezing enemies solid.\r\n- **[[Wraithborn Knights]]** – Ethereal warriors wielding weapons of solid moonlight, striking with precision before dissolving into mist.\r\n- **[[Void-Touched Reapers]]** – Beings of pure shadow and ice, leaving behind trails of absolute cold. They consume heat itself, turning the battlefield into a frozen graveyard.\r\n- **[[Shroudcallers]]** – Shades who have transcended physical form, manipulating the battlefield by summoning spectral frost and unnatural darkness.\r\n\r\n### **Behavior and Combat Tactics**\r\n\r\nShades **do not march—they drift, they whisper, they strike from the mist**. Their battles are not **raging infernos**, but **cold, methodical engagements** where the air itself turns against their enemies. They **sap heat, extinguish flames, and drain the will to fight**, their presence alone enough to frost weapons and still beating hearts.\r\n\r\nWhile [[Molten]] charge with reckless fury, Shades prefer to **isolate, weaken, and consume**. A battlefield overtaken by Shades is eerily **silent**, save for the crackling of ice and the distant echoes of the dead.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Ventri

He began preparing the tea, the scent of calming herbs filling the small space.\n\n“Troubled sleep, I presume?” Hemlock asked, his tone gentle. Elara nodded, running a hand through her tangled hair. “The whispers…they’re getting louder. About things in the caves.”\n\nHemlock chuckled, a dry rasping sound. \"Ah, yes. Old Man Tiber has been at it again.\" He gestured with a gnarled finger towards a hunched figure huddled near the hearth, stirring a murky liquid in a chipped mug. “Tiber Stonefist. Claims to have seen… _changes_ in the wildlife beyond the dragon farms. Mutated creatures, he says. Twisted by something dark.”\n\nElara frowned. \"I've heard him before. He’s always been prone to exaggeration.\"\n\n“Perhaps,” Hemlock conceded, placing her tea before her. “But Tiber isn’t malicious. Just… lonely. Lost his son years ago in a cave-in while mining azurite. Now he spends his days wandering the outskirts, claiming to see signs and omens. He says the creatures are growing bolder, more _wrong_. That their eyes glow with an unnatural light.”\n\nHemlock leaned closer, lowering his voice. “He claims they’re not just animals anymore. That something is… influencing them. Something old and hungry.\" He paused, studying Elara's face. \"He says the corruption started after the debris from Moonfall settled, seeping into the earth like a poison.”\n\nElara took a sip of her tea, its calming effects doing little to soothe her unease. “And you believe him?”\n\nHemlock shrugged. “I’ve lived long enough to know that even the wildest tales often have a grain of truth. Tiber isn't seeking attention; he seems genuinely frightened. He says he saw one – a rat, but… _different_. Pale and twitching, with holes burned through its fur as if touched by sunlight in the dark.”\n\nHe glanced towards Tiber, who was now staring intently into his mug, muttering under his breath about “shadows” and “awakening”. Hemlock sighed. \"Pay him no mind unless you start seeing things yourself. But… keep your eyes open, Elara. The caves have always held secrets. And some secrets are best left undisturbed.\"\n\nThe story establishes Tiber as a lonely, grieving man whose motivations stem from personal loss rather than malice. It casts doubt on his claims while simultaneously hinting at the possibility of something truly unsettling happening in the caves. His description of the mutated rat aligns with the notes about the corrupted wildlife and introduces the idea that Moonfall might be connected to the disturbances. The ending leaves Elara (and potentially the players) with a sense of unease and encourages further investigation.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109785,"nchars":2952},"82":{"title":"Hullsplitter Velric","path":"NPCs & Factions/Minor NPCs/Hullsplitter Velric.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1746742487198,"mtime":1746743048076,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/05/08 18:14:47","modified":"2025/05/08 18:24:08"},"id":"d149f03e8f64b0435b11ebc3b49a4e49","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Hullsplitter Velric]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/05/08 18:14:47\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 18:24:08\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n**Hullsplitter Velric**, as he’s known around the docks of [[Galazeth]], wasn't always a grizzled sky-shark hunter. Thirty years prior, he was a cartographer for the Dragon Harmony Collective, charting air currents and migratory routes of the docile dragon descendants used for transport. He left that life after witnessing firsthand how some unscrupulous merchants were exploiting the dragons, leading to several incidents of mistreatment. Velric vowed to protect the skies, shifting his focus to hunting sky-sharks – massive creatures that preyed on both travelers *and* the dragons, becoming a self-appointed guardian of the aerial routes. He funds his solitary work by selling shark hides and teeth, though he often gives away more than he keeps, particularly to those who show respect for the dragons.\n\nHis latest hunt began two weeks ago, tracking reports of an unusually aggressive sky-shark disrupting trade routes near the Azure Cliffs. Rumors spoke of a strange, blackening corruption spreading across its hide – whispers that were dismissed as sailor’s tales until Velric saw it himself. The creature wasn't just attacking ships; it was *changing*, radiating heat even from miles away. He pursued it in his airship, “The Windshear,” a sturdy vessel built with salvaged dragon bone and reinforced sails, hoping to end the threat before it reached [[Galazeth]]. He’d faced corrupted beasts before, remnants of [[Ashqua]]'s influence leaking into Magda, but nothing like this.\n\nThe encounter was a maelstrom of chaos. The air crackled with heat as the corrupted sky-shark, now visibly wreathed in black fire, slammed into The Windshear. Velric remembers the sickening crunch of dragon bone splintering, the smell of ozone and burning oil filling his lungs, and the terrifying shriek of the beast echoing across the clouds. He fought back with harpoons tipped with azurite – a mineral known to disrupt corrupted energies – but they barely seemed to slow it down. The shark’s hide felt…wrong, not scaled like a normal sky-shark, but slick and burning, radiating an unnatural heat that threatened to melt his ship around him. A final, devastating blow tore through the Windshear's engine, sending it spiraling downwards towards the jagged peaks below.\n\nVelric barely survived, crash-landing in a remote ravine outside [[Galazeth]]. He’s now nursing broken ribs and a haunted look, recounting his tale to anyone who will listen. The wreckage of The Windshear is still smoldering, attracting scavengers and sparking rumors about a new breed of corrupted sky-sharks threatening the trade routes. He believes the creature was more than just corrupted; it felt *directed*, as if guided by something intelligent.\n\nThis could lead to several story hooks: players might be tasked with salvaging parts from The Windshear, investigating the source of the corruption (potentially linking back to [[Molten]] influence or a new cult), or even joining Velric on a renewed hunt for the creature, now believed to be heading towards [[First Light]]. Rumors in taverns could mention sightings of similar corrupted sharks, and merchants might offer rewards for information leading to their destruction. Velric himself could become a valuable source of information about sky-shark behavior and the dangers lurking beyond [[Galazeth]], offering guidance or even a modified harpoon blueprint as a reward for assistance.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109786,"nchars":3539},"83":{"title":"NPC","path":"NPC.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762583,"mtime":1746725521364,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 13:32:01"},"id":"a9e28c5a14dd96028c6347bbace0ca6b","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[NPC]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:01\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Aurene, Candra, Backstory, Linked, Jesamine, Edrah\r\n\r\n[[Jesamine Edrah]] Linked to [[Aurene Candra]] backstory\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Player Characters Season 2]]\r\n- [[Drisraste Lunarshard]]\r\n- [[Aurene Candra]]\r\n- [[Eredarai Lunarshard]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Aravan Lunarshard]]\r\n- [[Charlie]]\r\n- [[Danger Dan]]\r\n- [[Delfin-Hail Thunder]]\r\n- [[Drisraste Lunarshard]]\r\n- [[Eredarai Lunarshard]]\r\n- [[Flam]]\r\n- [[Flim]]\r\n- [[Jesamine Edrah]]\r\n- [[Koda]]\r\n- [[Kuzu]]\r\n- [[Riwena Lunarshard]]\r\n- [[Sentrie-Storm Thunder]]\r\n- [[Zebzuib Lunarshard]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109787,"nchars":675},"84":{"title":"Naya","path":"Naya.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762578,"mtime":1746725521359,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 13:32:01"},"id":"df5c38fd8a9e9c333595415c5576d924","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Naya]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:01\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Mana, colors, Red, Green, White\r\n\r\nColors of Mana Red Green White\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Player Characters Season 2]]\r\n- [[Shade]]\r\n- [[2025-03-27]]\r\n- [[Shade]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Dren]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109787,"nchars":319},"85":{"title":"Narazir","path":"Narazir.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762577,"mtime":1746725521286,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 13:32:01"},"id":"3909077e81b8198af2784f759c3dc3b5","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Narazir]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:01\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Vedelkan, Graviturgey, Chaotic, Good, Sage, Quiet, Mountain, Spell, Thief, Archimage\r\n\r\n\r\n**Aliases:**  \r\n**Race:**  Vedelkan\r\n**Class/Occupation:**  Wizard(Graviturgey)\r\n**Age:**  26\r\n**Gender:**  Male\r\n**Alignment:**  [[Chaotic Good]]\r\n**Background:**  Sage\r\n**Affiliations:**  \r\n[[Aurene Candra]], [[Din Strider]], [[Dren]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Mumblebeard]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Theer]], [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] \r\n## 📝 Description  \r\n![[Pasted image 20250209222204.png]]\r\n## 🎭 Personality  \r\n\r\n## 🏹 Abilities & Skills  \r\nBoon of The Spell Thief; As a reaction to seeing a spell being cast, Narazir can cast that spell once per day.

The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it. When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\r\n\r\n- Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.\r\n- The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.\r\n- Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\r\n- Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.\r\n- Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\r\n- Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.\r\n\r\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.\r\n\r\nAt Higher Levels\r\n\r\nWhen you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.\r\n\r\nSpell | PHB 262\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Narazir]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109788,"nchars":2006},"87":{"title":"Mumblebeard","path":"Mumblebeard.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762574,"mtime":1746725521277,"tags":["#Nate","#Dwarf","#WizardOsteomancer","#LawfulNeutral","#QuandrixStudent","#NewSolarRepublic","#StormValley"],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/05/08 13:32:01"},"id":"df419fbe6d1bd8c349e5888276e0debb","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Mumblebeard]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:01\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #Nate, #Dwarf, #WizardOsteomancer, #LawfulNeutral, #QuandrixStudent, #NewSolarRepublic, #StormValley\r\n\r\n# Player name: Nate\r\n\r\n**Aliases:**  \r\n**Race:**  Dwarf(Mountain)\r\n**Class/Occupation:**  Wizard(Osteomancer) Started abjuration\r\n**Age:**  45\r\n**Gender:**  Male\r\n**Alignment:**  [[Lawful Netural]] [[Dimir]]\r\n**Background:**  Quandrix Student\r\n**Affiliations:**  \r\n[[Nerrath]], [[Aurene Candra]], [[Din Strider]], [[Dren]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Theer]], [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] \r\n## 📝 Description  \r\n![[Pasted image 20250210001326.png]]\r\n\r\n## 🎭 Personality  \r\n\r\n## 🏹 Abilities & Skills  \r\n\r\n\r\n## ⚔️ Equipment  \r\n\r\n## 📖 History  \r\ntook up the first shard of [[Nerrath]]\r\n## 🧩 Relationships  \r\n- **Allies:** (Friends, family, mentors)  \r\n\r\n- **Rivals/Enemies:** (Who opposes them and why?)  \r\n\r\n## 🏔️ Locations Associated  \r\n- **Hometown:**  [[New Solar Republic]], [[Daybreak]], [[Onyx Rocks]]\r\n- **Frequented Places:**  [[Storm Valley]], \r\n\r\n## 🎭 Notable Quotes  \r\n> \"A quote that represents the character.\"\r\n\r\n## 🏆 Goals & Motivations  \r\n- **Short-Term Goals:**  \r\n- **Long-Term Goals:**  \r\n\r\n## 🗂️ Notes & Trivia  \r\n- Fun facts, inspirations, or additional details.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n**Tags:** `#character #DND` (or adjust for your system)  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]\r\n- [[Felladrian]]\r\n- [[Orin Talonsbane]]\r\n- [[Theer]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Aurene Candra]]\r\n- [[Din Strider]]\r\n- [[Dren]]\r\n- [[Felladrian]]\r\n- [[Flux]]\r\n- [[Igni]]\r\n- [[Narazir]]\r\n- [[Okami]]\r\n- [[Orin Talonsbane]]\r\n- [[Player Characters Season 2]]\r\n- [[Theer]]\r\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109788,"nchars":1783},"88":{"title":"Mutated Wildlife","path":"Monsters & Encounters/Mutated Wildlife.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1746388244976,"mtime":1746739142383,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/05/04 15:50:44","modified":"2025/05/08 17:19:02"},"id":"359e2723767823926d5d430ee24b873f","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Mutated Wildlife]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/05/04 15:50:44\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:19:02\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n### 1.

They leave trails of burning radiance wherever they fly and drain not just blood but also the warmth from their victims.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463109789,"nchars":4073},"89":{"title":"Molten","path":"Molten.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762571,"mtime":1743340101668,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:08:21"},"id":"2b34bf818f43ca5906fddc829b890bb4","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Molten]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Ashqua, Corruption, Molten, Thralls, Living, Flame, Magma, Charred, Bone\r\n\r\n### **Molten**\r\n\r\nMolten are beings that have been corrupted by [[Ashqua]], their bodies and souls consumed by her relentless, burning will. No longer truly human—or whatever they once were—they exist as **living embers of her wrath**, bound in eternal servitude to the imprisoned sun goddess.\r\n\r\n### **Transformation and Corruption**\r\n\r\nThe process of becoming Molten is not instantaneous. [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] influence **warps both flesh and spirit**, altering her victims in stages:\r\n\r\n- **Early Corruption**: Skin becomes feverishly hot, veins glow like smoldering coals, and the afflicted develop an unnatural resistance to fire. They begin hearing [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] whispers.\r\n- **Mid Corruption**: Hair burns away, flesh blackens and cracks, revealing molten light beneath. Their movements become erratic, driven by bursts of flame. They lose their identity, speaking only in [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] name.\r\n- **Complete Transformation**: The last shreds of their former selves are burned away. Their bodies become **charred husks of obsidian and molten rock**, their eyes searing like miniature suns. They no longer think—only obey.\r\n\r\n### **Physical Appearance**\r\n\r\nMolten beings vary depending on the depth of their corruption. Some retain **humanoid silhouettes**, while others have melted into **unrecognizable forms of flowing magma and charred bone**. The most powerful among them become **pure living flame**, shedding all traces of a solid form.\r\n\r\n### **Types of Molten**\r\n\r\n- **[[Molten Thralls]]** – Newly turned, still bearing remnants of their former selves. Their flesh is cracked and burning, but they retain vague memories, making them hesitant in battle.\r\n- **[[Blazing Husks]]** – Fully transformed warriors of [[Ashqua]], their bodies reduced to little more than charred frames filled with molten energy. They explode upon death.\r\n- **[[Infernal Stalkers]]** – Faster, more agile Molten that leave fiery footprints as they hunt. Their claws can ignite the air itself.\r\n- **[[Molten Titans]]** – Towering monstrosities that radiate unbearable heat. They wield weapons of molten metal and leave rivers of fire in their wake.\r\n- **[[Ashbound Priests]]** – Those who willingly gave themselves to[[Ashqua]], now her prophets of flame. They channel her divine fire into devastating rituals.\r\n\r\n### **Behavior and Combat Tactics**\r\n\r\nMolten do not feel pain or fear. They attack **relentlessly, spreading flame wherever they tread**. Some **burn out quickly in violent bursts**, while others smolder slowly, enduring strikes that would fell mortal warriors. Their presence alone **warps the battlefield**, causing metal to soften, wood to ignite, and the air to shimmer with heat.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n- [[The Tale of the

The lack of expectations cause a divide between him and his older siblings, but he was close to the fourth sibling in line, his sister Mecelle. Shortly before his 5th birthday, mecelle was sent away on account of an arranged marriage, leaving drenari by himself. He began acting up, pranking and stealing around the family grounds. When it was discovered that he was blessed by the gods, his family was more than happy to send him away. \n\n  \n\nPublicly known as medical professionals, the lunarshard clan trains all the doctors on their island. Behind closed doors, they have been secretly keeping the lycanthropy bloodlines alive. Dren has yet to undergo the ritual to become a lycanthrope.

They have encountered mutated wildlife and a CR 6 spiderdragon corrupted by molten energy. The spiderdragon, having been fought, has fled, and the party is believed to be chasing it.\n\n**New Information:** The spiderdragon is nesting in a **hidden shrine** that is the source of the \"molten corruption\" and the irregularities around the town of Magda. The shrine's atmosphere and visuals will be heavily inspired by the song \"Garden of Bones\" by Galdorcraeft.\n\n---\n\n## Session Goal\n* The party successfully tracks the injured spiderdragon.\n* They engage the spiderdragon in a final confrontation within its lair, the \"Garden of Bones\" shrine.\n* They discover the true nature of the shrine as the source of Magda's irregularities.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: The Chase Through the Corrupted Caves\n\nThe spiderdragon is wounded and fleeing, aiming to reach the sanctuary of its lair – the hidden shrine.\n\n### 1. Setting the Scene\n* **Recap:** Remind players of the spiderdragon's escape and their pursuit.\n* **Sensory Details:** Emphasize the escalating heat, the pervasive smell of ozone and sulfur, and the constant chittering of unseen, molten-corrupted wildlife. The air grows thick and heavy. As they go deeper, the natural caves begin to give way to something unnatural.\n\n### 2. The Chase Mechanics (Skill Challenge)\nPresent a series of obstacles requiring different skills over 3-5 \"rounds\" of chase. Successes gain ground; failures lead to minor setbacks or hazards.\n\n* **Round 1: Tracking/Navigation**\n    * **Challenge:** The caves branch frequently; the spiderdragon tries to obscure its path.\n    * **Skills:** DC 13-15 Wisdom (Survival) to follow tracks, or DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) to spot subtle clues (molten scorch marks, shed chitin).\n    * **Outcome:** Success means gaining ground. Failure means losing ground or taking a longer, more dangerous path.\n\n* **Round 2: Environmental Hazard - Molten Pools**\n    * **Challenge:** A chamber crisscrossed by glowing, bubbling streams of molten rock.\n    * **Skills:** DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to jump/balance, or DC 13 Strength (Athletics) to navigate.\n    * **Outcome:** Failure risks 1d6-2d6 fire damage and/or being slowed.\n\n* **Round 3: Corrupted Wildlife Ambush/Distraction**\n    * **Challenge:** The spiderdragon kicks down a cluster of pulsating, molten-corrupted bats (use *Swarm of Bats* stat block, +1 fire damage per hit, glow) or stirs up mutated centipedes.\n    * **Skills:** Quick combat encounter (1-2 rounds) against minor threats, or DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) to slip past.\n    * **Outcome:** Distraction causes time loss or minor damage.\n\n* **Round 4: Obstacle - Dense, Glowing Webs**\n    * **Challenge:** Passages choked with thick, superheated, obsidian-like webbing.\n    * **Skills:** DC 14 Strength (Athletics) to tear through, or DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to find weak points.\n    * **Outcome:** Contact with webs deals 1d4 fire damage. Failure risks entanglement.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: The Spiderdragon's Lair - The Garden of Bones Shrine\n\nThe chase culminates in a distinct, unnaturally carved cavern system: the \"Garden of Bones\" shrine.\n\n### 1. Lair Description\n* **Appearance:** This vast, unnaturally carved chamber is lit by the oppressive, intense orange/red glow from numerous fissures and bubbling molten pools. Jagged stalactites drip not water, but slow beads of liquid fire. The air shimmers with heat, thick with the smell of sulfur, ozone, and something metallic, like hot blood and rust.\n* **The \"Garden\":** The most striking feature. The floor and lower walls are choked with a horrific forest of **molten-infused skeletal remains.** These bones are fused into the rock, standing upright like grotesque, glowing plants. Some are humanoid, others monstrous, all dripping with slow beads of molten ichor.\n* **Lyrical Integration (Visual/Atmosphere):**\n    * \"This is the **Garden of Bones**, where shadows dance and memories cease.\" (Describe distorted light, unsettling aura).\n    * \"From the **ash and dust**, new horrors bloom in silent, grim embrace.\" (Emphasize the twisted life and decay).\n    * \"The ground itself is **cold and stark**, a tapestry of graves.\" (Despite heat, sense of pervasive death).\n* **Aural Cues:** The hiss and pop of cooling lava, distant earth rumbling, and faint, melancholic whispers or discordant moans seemingly emanating from the skeletal growths.\n* **Hazards:**\n    * **Molten Patches:** Any creature entering a molten patch space takes 2d6 fire damage.\n    * **Molten Webs:** Webs are difficult terrain. Anyone moving through or touching them takes 1d4 fire damage. Breaking them requires a DC 12 Strength check or fire damage.\n\n### 2. The Spiderdragon's Role & Tactics\nThe young spiderdragon is a product and protector of the shrine's corruption, likely more aggressive and heavily mutated.\n* **Elevated Threat:** Consider a minor boost (a few more HP, a legendary resistance, or an additional \"Molten Burst\" area attack) to reflect its connection to the shrine.\n* **Tactics:** It will use the bone growths and molten streams for cover and strategic attacks, spitting corrosive venom/molten webbing, and attempting to push characters into hazards. It defends its \"garden\" fiercely.\n* **Optional Minions:** 1-2 \"Molten Spiders\" (reskin *Giant Spiders*: bite deals 1d4 bonus fire damage, web is sticky + 1d4 fire damage on contact) emerge, drawn by the conflict.\n\n### 3. The Final Confrontation\nMake the fight cinematic, leveraging the shrine's environment.

This is a direct link to the source of corruption.\n\n### 2. The Source of Corruption: The Twisted Heart of the Garden\nAt the very heart of the shrine, likely where the spiderdragon nested, lies the true source of Magda's irregularities:\n* **The Desecrated Altar/Heartstone:** A glowing, pulsating mass of **obsidian and crystalline bone**, embedded in the earth or atop a crude altar, constantly oozing fresh molten corruption. Around it, the bone-plants are densest and most unnaturally vibrant.\n* **The Irregularities (Possible Effects in Magda):**\n    * **Minor Mutations:** Farm animals developing strange growths or aggressive tendencies.\n    * **Environmental Blight:** Patches of plant life dying or becoming twisted and carnivorous.\n    * **Psychological Effects:** Strange nightmares, increased paranoia, or unusual fevers among townsfolk.\n    * **Temporal Flux:** Minor time distortions, objects appearing or disappearing briefly.\n\n### 3. Post-Combat Discoveries\nInteracting with the Molten Heartstone/Altar could trigger:\n* A sudden **flash of disturbing images:** A forgotten ritual, ancient figures, a sacrifice, or a dark power being unleashed.\n* A **wave of psychic feedback:** Filling their minds with fragmented whispers, perhaps sounding like verses from \"Garden of Bones.\"\n* A **horrific realization:** The shrine is actively *absorbing* something (life force, sanity, time) from the area, twisting it into the molten blight.\n* **Further Clues:** Find offerings around the altar (tarnished religious artifacts, strange symbols) or a **journal/scroll** detailing the shrine's purpose and its connection to Magda. This journal could explicitly name the \"Garden of Bones\" or the ritual.\n\n---\n\n## Post-Session Questions for Players\n* \"What do you do now that the spiderdragon is defeated?\"\n* \"Do you try to investigate the source of this molten energy further, or do you head back to the farms to report what you've found?\"\n* \"What are your characters feeling/thinking after this encounter?\"","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463111129,"nchars":2802},"125":{"title":"Session 1 Plan","path":"Campagin Notes/Chapter 1/Session 1 Plan.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1746382184367,"mtime":1746388244512,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/05/04 14:09:44","modified":"2025/05/04 15:50:44"},"id":"90dc236b7215bb6fc7c5fdf23d371fb5","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Session 1 Plan]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/05/04 14:09:44\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/04 15:50:44\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n## Whispers in the Caves - Opening Beats\n**Session Summary:** This session introduces the players to [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) and its growing problem with agitated dragons and strange occurrences near the dragon farms. The party will be tasked by [Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar) to investigate initial reports, leading them into the caves where they’ll encounter their first challenges – both combat and clues – hinting at a larger threat.\n\n**Scene Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Arrival in Magda (30-45 mins):** Players arrive in [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md), either as locals or travelers. Focus on establishing the atmosphere described in the note: labyrinthine city, stone & metal scent, dragon farms nearby. Introduce key locations like the [Glimmering Grotto](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FGlimmering%20Grotto.md) and potentially [The Root & Vine](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FThe%20Root%20%26%20Vine.md).\n2. **Brynjar’s Request (30 mins):** Players are summoned to meet with [[Elder Brynjar]], who explains the growing unrest among the dragons and requests their assistance in investigating the caves near the dragon farms. This is where the initial quest is given: investigate reports of agitated dragons.\n3. **Dragon Farm Investigation (45-60 mins):** The party visits a nearby dragon farm, interacting with concerned farmers and witnessing firsthand the agitated state of the dragons. They gather clues about strange behavior and potentially encounter a minor incident – a frightened [[Root Drake]] nearly breaking free.\n4. **Cave Entrance & Initial Exploration (60-90 mins):** Players enter the caves near the farms. This scene focuses on exploration, description, and a first combat encounter. The goal is to introduce the unsettling atmosphere of the caves and hint at something amiss.\n\n**Encounters:**\n\n- **Agitated Dragon (Non-Lethal Focus):** A young, frightened dragon (use stats for a very young/small dragon – perhaps reskinning a wolf or large dog stat block) that is agitated but not actively malicious. The encounter should focus on calming the dragon rather than fighting it. Success could involve skill checks (Animal Handling, Persuasion) and offering soothing herbs from [Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock).\n- **[[Mutated Wildlife]] (Combat):** 2-3 mutated creatures affected by Ashqua’s energy (reskin rats or bats with slightly increased stats and a creepy appearance). This is the first combat encounter – keep it simple and manageable for level 1 characters. Focus on establishing that something _is_ wrong, not necessarily a full-blown threat.\n- **Hidden Shrine (Investigation):** A small shrine dedicated to nature spirits, defiled or corrupted with strange symbols. Requires investigation skill checks to uncover clues about the corruption.\n\n**Roleplay & NPCs:**\n\n- **[Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar):** Portray her as wise and concerned, but also hesitant to jump to conclusions. She should emphasize the importance of understanding the situation before resorting to violence. Focus on her connection to nature and dragons.\n- **Farmers:** Play them as stressed and worried about their livelihood. They can provide rumors about the “red glow” in the caves and whispers of old legends.\n- **[Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock):** A source of local lore and herbal remedies. He can offer clues about the defiled shrine and suggest calming herbs for the dragons.\n\n**Hooks & Momentum:**\n\nEnd the session with a cliffhanger: While exploring deeper into the caves, the party discovers evidence of a hidden chamber or tunnel leading further down. They also find a strange energy fluctuation detected by their equipment (or a character’s intuition). This sets up Session 2's exploration of “Deeper Descent.”\n\n**Prep Work:**\n\n- **Maps:** Sketch out a simple map of [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) and the surrounding dragon farms, as well as a basic cave layout for the initial exploration area.\n- **Creature Stat Blocks:** Prepare stat blocks for the agitated dragon (reskinned), mutated wildlife, and any other creatures you anticipate encountering.\n- **NPC Profiles:** Flesh out brief profiles for [Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar), farmers, and [Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock). Include key personality traits and dialogue prompts.\n- **Handouts:** Consider a simple handout with rumors circulating in [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) or a map of the dragon farms.\n- **Skill Check Lists:** Have a list of relevant skill checks prepared for each scene (e.g., Animal Handling, Persuasion, Investigation).\n\n  \n###Tldr lolz\n*   Players arrive in Magda, a labyrinthine city with nearby dragon farms, and are introduced to the setting.\n*   Elder Brynjar tasks the party with investigating reports of unrest among dragons near the farms.\n*   The investigation leads to a dragon farm where they witness agitated dragons and gather clues.\n*   Players explore caves near the farms, encountering their first combat (mutated wildlife) and a non-lethal encounter with a frightened young dragon.\n*   A defiled shrine is discovered within the caves, hinting at corruption and requiring investigation skill checks.\n*   The session ends on a cliffhanger – discovery of a hidden chamber/tunnel and detection of strange energy fluctuations.\n*   Key NPCs include Elder Brynjar (wise & concerned), stressed farmers, and Old Man Hemlock (lore source).\n*   Prep work includes maps, creature stat blocks, NPC profiles, handouts, and skill check lists.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463111130,"nchars":5809},"126":{"title":"Outline","path":"Campagin Notes/Chapter 1/Outline.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762980,"mtime":1743341313603,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:28:33"},"id":"808a35d2a65ca88b184dfec5015db506","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Outline]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:28:33\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\nOkay, excellent! A level 1-5 arc culminating in acquiring the “Star” provides a clear goal. Here’s a plan for your first campaign chapter, broken down into stages with note organization suggestions:\n\n**Overall Chapter Theme:** *Uncovering the Truth & Containing the Threat* – The party starts as relatively unaware investigators and gradually pieces together the puzzle of Ashqua's awakening while attempting to mitigate the immediate consequences.\n\n**I. Initial Investigation (Levels 1-2): \"Whispers in the Caves\"**\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Magda is experiencing increased tremors, strange animal behavior, and unsettling rumors. The party begins as locals or travelers drawn into the situation.\n*   **Initial Quest:** A request from [[Elder Brynjar]] (or a local authority) to investigate reports of unusual activity in the caves near dragon farms. Farmers are reporting their dragons becoming agitated and even aggressive.\n*   **Key Locations:** Dragon Farms, outskirts of Magda, initial cave entrances.\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   Agitated Dragons (low-level combat). Focus on non-lethal solutions initially – calming the beasts rather than killing them.\n    *   Strange creatures emerging from tunnels (e.g., mutated wildlife affected by Ashqua’s energy).\n    *   A hidden shrine dedicated to nature spirits, defiled or corrupted.\n*   **Clues:**\n    *   Evidence of strange energy fluctuations detected by [[Lorekeepers]].\n    *   Reports of a “red glow” emanating from deeper within the caves.\n    *   Whispers about the old legends of Ashqua and the sealed prison.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Detailed descriptions of Dragon Farms & initial cave entrances.\n    *   Stat blocks for low-level creatures and agitated dragons.\n    *   NPC profiles: [[Elder Brynjar]], concerned farmers, a local herbalist who provides clues about the defiled shrine.\n    *   A \"Rumors\" section listing what locals are saying.\n\n**II. Deeper Descent (Levels 2-3): “Echoes of the Past”**\n\n*   **Quest Expansion:** The party discovers that the disturbances aren’t natural and begin to investigate the history of Magda and its connection to Ashqua.\n*   **Key Locations:** [[Glimmering Grotto]], [[Heartstone Chamber]] (seeking information from council members), deeper sections of the caves, potentially the [[Echoing Chasm]].\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   Cultists attempting to sabotage investigations or harness Ashqua’s power.\n    *   Cave-ins and treacherous terrain within the tunnels.\n    *   Guardians protecting ancient secrets (e.g., animated stone constructs).\n*   **Clues:**\n    *   Ancient texts in [[Heartstone Chamber]] revealing details about Ashqua's imprisonment and the “Star.”\n    *   Discovering a hidden chamber containing remnants of the United Mortal Pact that sealed Ashqua away.\n    *   Finding evidence of the High Priestess [[Ayzat]]’s manipulation of Ashqua.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Detailed descriptions of key locations within Magda (Grotto, Chamber, Chasm).\n    *   Stat blocks for cultists and guardians.\n    *   NPC profiles: Council members, [[Torvin Stonebeard]] providing warnings about cave stability.\n    *   Excerpts from ancient texts detailing Ashqua’s history.\n\n**III. The Source (Levels 3-4): “The Vein of Azurite”**\n\n*   **Quest Focus:** Following clues leads the party to the [[Vein of Azurite]], where they discover the artifact – the \"Star\" – is weakening and Ashqua’s influence is strongest.\n*   **Key Locations:** The [[Vein of Azurite]], surrounding tunnels, potentially a hidden chamber containing remnants of the sealing ritual.\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   More powerful cultists guarding the Star.\n    *   Creatures fully corrupted by Ashqua’s energy (e.g., molten elementals).\n    *   A challenging puzzle or obstacle protecting the artifact.\n*   **Clues:**\n    *   Discovering that the “Star” isn't just a seal but also a source of power for Ashqua, and its weakening is accelerating her awakening.\n    *   Learning about the [[Unwritten]]’s role in both Ashqua’s ascension and potential escape.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Detailed description of the [[Vein of Azurite]] and surrounding area.\n    *   Stat blocks for corrupted creatures and powerful cultists.\n    *   Puzzle design for protecting the artifact.\n\n**IV. Securing the Star (Level 5): “A Fragile Victory”**\n\n*   **Climax:** The party must secure the \"Star\" and attempt to reinforce its seal, facing a final confrontation with Ashqua’s forces.\n*   **Key Locations:** [[Vein of Azurite]], potentially a collapsing section of the caves as Ashqua's power grows.\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   A powerful boss encounter – perhaps a corrupted champion of Ashqua or a creature empowered by her energy.\n    *   A desperate attempt to stabilize the seal on the Star, requiring skill checks and teamwork.\n*   **Outcome:** The party successfully secures the \"Star,\" but it’s clear that Ashqua is still far from defeated. They have bought time, but the threat remains.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Stat block for the final boss encounter.\n    *   Detailed description of the collapsing caves and the urgency of the situation.\n    *   Rules for reinforcing the seal on the Star (skill checks, resource expenditure).\n\n**V. Chapter Wrap-Up:**\n\n*   The party returns to Magda as heroes, but with a sense of foreboding.\n*   They’ve learned about Ashqua's history, her motivations, and the looming threat she poses.\n*   This sets the stage for future chapters focused on finding ways to permanently defeat Ashqua or prepare for her inevitable return.\n\n**Organization Tips:**\n\n*   **Dedicated Notes:** Create separate notes for each key location, NPC, creature, and clue.\n*   **Linking:** Use Obsidian’s linking feature extensively to connect related information.\n*   **Tags:** Tag notes with relevant keywords\n*   **Timeline:** Create a timeline of events leading up to the campaign and during the first chapter.","embedding":[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],"created_at":1750463111131,"nchars":6073},"127":{"title":"Outline","path":"Campagin Notes/Chapter 1/Outline.md","embeddingModel":"text-embedding-nomic-embed-text-v1.5@q8_0","ctime":1743310762980,"mtime":1743341313603,"tags":[],"extension":"md","metadata":{"created":"2025/03/30 00:59:22","modified":"2025/03/30 09:28:33"},"id":"f1776f41d9cc2118dcaad804f57e2cd8","content":"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Outline]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:28:33\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n(cont'd) This is just a starting point, of course.

Her molten skin radiates unbearable heat, her hair flows like living fire, and her eyes burn with an unending, golden inferno. Once a beautiful and benevolent ruler, she has been reshaped by the raw power of primordial light into a monstrous entity of pure destruction.\n\nWIP image insperation\n![[Ashqua.jpg]]\n## Personality\n\nOnce kind and fair, [[Ashqua]] was manipulated into paranoia and tyranny. Her fear of losing control led her to reject balance, ultimately transforming her into a cruel ruler. She views the world as hers to command, believing that without her light, all life would perish.\n\n## Abilities and Skills\n\n- **[[Solar Dominion]]:** Controls the sun’s fire and light, capable of raising temperatures to unbearable levels.\n- **[[Molten Rebirth]]:** Fallen warriors under her command are resurrected as molten husks, bound to her will.\n- **[[Eternal Day]]:** Has the power to prevent the sun from setting, casting the world into an unending day.\n- **[[Divine Presence]]:** Her mere presence scorches the land, making prolonged encounters with her dangerous.\n\n## Equipment\n\n- **[[Crown of Day Break]]**: An artifact that amplifies her dominion over fire and light.\n- **[[Blade of the Solar Flare]]:** A weapon wreathed in eternal flames, capable of cutting through the strongest of defenses.\n\n\n## Classes\n\n- **Bladesinging Wizard**: Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.\n- **Oathbreaker**: An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.\n## History\n\nBorn a mortal, Ashqua ascended to godhood alongside her sister, [[Nerrath]], with the aid of the enigmatic [[Unwritten]]. As ruler of the Day Kingdom, she ensured prosperity and warmth, but was ultimately deceived by a High Priestess who sought to unlock forbidden primordial power.\n\nBlinded by ambition and fear, Ashqua was consumed by an entity of pure fire, transforming into the tyrannical goddess she is today. She waged war against her sister, refusing to let the sun set, plunging the world into **[[The Eclipse Wars]]**. In the ensuing war, the land was shattered, giving rise to the scattered isles that exist today.\n\nAfter the devastating War of [[The Eclipse Wars]], Ashqua was sealed away in the center of the Dyson Sphere. This was achieved through the United Mortal Pact, an agreement between [[Nerrath]], the ancient dragons, and the mortals.\n\n## Relationships\n\n- **[[Nerrath]] (Sister, Goddess of the Moon):** Once her closest companion, now her eternal rival.\n- **The High Priestess [[Ayzat]]:** A manipulative figure who led Ashqua down her dark path.\n- **The [[Unwritten]]:** Mysterious off world beings who aided in her apotheosis but have since become her enemy.\n## Trivia\n\n- Ashqua was once known for her golden laughter, which could brighten the darkest days. Now, her voice is like crackling flame.\n- Her followers believe that one day, she will burn away all impurity, leaving only her light behind.\n\n\n\n### Intentions\n\nWhen **Ashqua ascended to godhood**, she glimpsed the greater fabric of reality, the unseen forces shaping existence. She saw that the **Shattered Isles were never meant to persist.** Their story was supposed to end, their fate written in the stars. Yet something **unnatural** kept them lingering—**The Unwritten.**\n\nThese formless, discarded ideas, half-told stories, and broken fates had taken root, corrupting reality itself. The world **refused to die**, its final chapter left unfinished. And in doing so, it had become a **cancer upon the multiverse.**\n\nOnly **she** could fix it.

The town is built around natural hot springs that are believed to have special powers, especially for those with dragon blood.\n\nThe buildings in Brigid use smooth stones and flowing water, making the town peaceful and respectful. It's a busy trading center where goods are exchanged with other islands. However, most people come to Brigid because of the healing springs. You’ll see lots of boats in the harbor and buildings close together that were designed based on the moon. There are also many people who work hard to protect old stories about dragons.\n\nThe town is known for its “Dragon Healers,” people who understand how to use the spring's energy to heal others. Some say the goddess [[Nerrath]] blessed these waters a long time ago, giving them special magic. \n\nBrigid is located in an area called [[Críoch Skolvar]], \"The Border of the Fallen.\" The town got its name from a Celtic goddess who was known for healing and craftsmanship. Long ago, followers of [[Nerrath]] came to this place looking for peace near the springs. Later, people wounded during wars came here too. \n\n**Demographics:**\n\n- **Population:** Approximately 450 inhabitants\n- **Races:** Predominantly Human (70%), with notable populations of Half-Elves (15%) drawn to the area’s natural beauty and restorative energies, and a small number of Dragonborn (10%) who maintain ties to ancient dragon lore. The remaining 5% are comprised of various other races.\n- **Alignment:** Generally [[Neutral Good]] – residents prioritize community well-being and peaceful coexistence.\n\n**Key Locations:**\n\n- **[[The Healing Springs]]:** Located just outside town, these naturally occurring springs are renowned for their restorative properties. They’re said to be blessed by [[Nerrath]] herself, capable of mending even grievous wounds.\n- **[[Brigid's Hearth]]:** The central marketplace and gathering place, named after the goddess Brigid. It features stalls selling local crafts, medicinal herbs, and fresh produce.\n- **[[The Stone Watchtower]]:** A weathered stone tower overlooking the coast, providing a vantage point for spotting incoming ships or potential threats.\n- **[[The Lunar Shrine]]:** A small shrine dedicated to [[Nerrath]] where locals offer prayers and seek guidance. It’s maintained by [[Sister Elowen]] (see Important NPCs).\n- **[[Blacksmith's Forge]]:** Run by [[Master Torvin]], known for crafting exceptional weapons and tools using ore sourced from nearby islands.\n\n**Important NPCs:**\n\n- **[[Sister Elowen]]:** A devout follower of [[Nerrath]], she tends to [[The Lunar Shrine]] and provides healing services to the community. She possesses a deep understanding of local lore and is often sought for advice.\n- **[[Master Torvin]]:** A gruff but skilled blacksmith, renowned for his craftsmanship. He’s known to be secretive about his techniques, passed down through generations.\n- **[[Old Man Hemlock]]:** An eccentric herbalist who lives on the outskirts of town. He possesses extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and is rumored to have connections to ancient dragon lore.\n- **[[Captain Valeria]]:** The captain of the local guard, responsible for maintaining order and protecting [[Brigid]] from threats. She’s a pragmatic leader with a strong sense of duty.\n\n**Economy and Trade:**\n\n- **Primary Industries:** Fishing, crafting (blacksmithing, weaving, herbalism), healing services.\n- **Trade Goods:** Medicinal herbs, crafted weapons and tools, woven textiles, fresh fish, and spring water bottled for sale to travelers.\n- **Trading Partners:** [Ayula.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Ayula.md), [Kinnan.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Kinnan.md), and occasional traders from the [Gealaí Enclave.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Geala%C3%AD%20Enclave.md). Brigid also trades with passing ships seeking restorative waters.\n\n**Local Rumors and Conflicts:**\n\n- **The Whispers of Ashqua:** Some locals claim to hear whispers on the wind, believed to be remnants of [Ashqua.md](obsidian://open?vault=The%20Shattered%20Isles&file=Ashqua.md)’s influence seeping into the region. They fear a resurgence of darkness.\n- **Dragonborn Discontent:** A small faction of Dragonborn in Brigid believes that the town is not doing enough to honor their ancestors and preserve dragon lore. This has led to tensions with other residents.\n- **The Missing Fishermen:** Several fishermen have gone missing at sea, sparking rumors of a monstrous creature lurking beneath the waves. Captain Valeria is investigating but has found no conclusive evidence.\n- **Smuggler Activity:** There are whispers of smugglers using Brigid as a port for illicit goods, taking advantage of its remote location and lax security."],[110,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Character Template]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:15:22\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #CharacterProfile, #Traits, #Ideals, #Flaws, #Abilities, #History, #Relationships\n\n# {{Character Name}}\n\n**Aliases:**  \n**Race:**  \n**Class/Occupation:**  \n**Age:**  \n**Gender:**  \n**Alignment:**  \n**Background:**  \n**Affiliations:**  \n\n## 📝 Description  \nA brief physical and personality description.

The lack of expectations cause a divide between him and his older siblings, but he was close to the fourth sibling in line, his sister Mecelle. Shortly before his 5th birthday, mecelle was sent away on account of an arranged marriage, leaving drenari by himself. He began acting up, pranking and stealing around the family grounds. When it was discovered that he was blessed by the gods, his family was more than happy to send him away. \n\n  \n\nPublicly known as medical professionals, the lunarshard clan trains all the doctors on their island. Behind closed doors, they have been secretly keeping the lycanthropy bloodlines alive. Dren has yet to undergo the ritual to become a lycanthrope.

The Nature of the Agitation:** Instead of simply stating dragons are agitated, Brynjar should describe _how_ they're behaving differently. She could mention:\n\n- “Their usual playful curiosity has turned to…restlessness. A frantic energy I haven’t witnessed in centuries.”\n- \"They seem disturbed by something deep within the earth itself – a tremor that resonates not just physically, but...spiritually.\"\n- She might note they are exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of dragons affected by ancient curses or corrupted energies (drawing on lore from [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md) and [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md)).\n\n**2. Linking to Natural Energies & Lorekeeper Concerns:** Brynjar should emphasize the connection between dragon behavior and Magda’s natural energies, referencing her role as a Lorekeeper:\n\n- “As Lorekeepers, we monitor the flow of energy within Magda. Lately, that flow has become…turbulent. The dragons are sensitive to these shifts.”\n- She could mention studying the [Vein of Azurite](app://obsidian.md/Vein%20of%20Azurite) and noticing unusual fluctuations coinciding with the dragon’s agitation. This subtly introduces a key location and potential source of corruption.\n\n**3. Hints of Moonfall & Deeper Disturbances:** Brynjar can express concern about the long-term effects of [Moonfall](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FMoonfall.md), linking it to the current unrest:\n\n- “Since the debris from [Moonfall](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FMoonfall.md) fell, we’ve observed a…fragility in the ecosystem. A vulnerability that seems to be attracting something _unnatural_.”\n- She might mention reports of unusual creatures emerging from deeper tunnels (as noted in [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md)) and express worry they are connected to the disturbances.\n\n**4. Subtle Clues & Foreshadowing:**\n\n- Brynjar could show the party a piece of corrupted flora found near an agitated dragon, hinting at a spreading influence.\n- She might mention a disturbing dream or vision she experienced, referencing unsettling imagery related to darkness and imprisonment (a subtle nod to Ashqua).\n- When discussing the dragons’ distress, Brynjar can express concern about a growing “shadow” over Magda, subtly foreshadowing Ashqua's awakening.\n\n**5. The Task & Initial Investigation:** Brynjar should task the party with investigating the dragon farms and initial cave entrances (as outlined in [Outline](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FOutline.md)), specifically asking them to:\n\n- Observe the dragons’ behavior closely.\n- Look for any signs of unusual energy or corruption.\n- Report back immediately if they find anything concerning.\n\nBy incorporating these elements, we can establish a sense of unease and foreshadow the larger threats lurking beneath Magda, setting the stage for the campaign's unfolding mysteries while leveraging the detailed lore provided in the notes.\n\n\n\n\n##TLDR :P\n*   Brynjar should describe *how* dragons are agitated, beyond simply stating they are, mentioning restlessness, spiritual disturbance, or behaviors linked to ancient curses.\n*   The agitation is connected to fluctuations in Magda’s natural energies, which Brynjar monitors as a Lorekeeper; the Vein of Azurite shows unusual activity.\n*   Moonfall has created ecosystem fragility and vulnerability, potentially attracting something unnatural and leading to reports of new creatures.\n*   Subtle clues like corrupted flora, disturbing dreams/visions, and concern about a growing “shadow” foreshadow deeper threats (like Ashqua).\n*   The party is tasked with investigating dragon farms and cave entrances, observing for unusual energy or corruption and reporting back immediately."],[137,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Ember Bat]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/06/16 15:29:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/06/16 15:30:02\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n![[Ember bat (01).png]]\n\n**Description:** These bats are unnaturally silent, their wings trailing wisps of smoke.

Thirty years prior, he was a cartographer for the Dragon Harmony Collective, charting air currents and migratory routes of the docile dragon descendants used for transport. He left that life after witnessing firsthand how some unscrupulous merchants were exploiting the dragons, leading to several incidents of mistreatment. Velric vowed to protect the skies, shifting his focus to hunting sky-sharks – massive creatures that preyed on both travelers *and* the dragons, becoming a self-appointed guardian of the aerial routes. He funds his solitary work by selling shark hides and teeth, though he often gives away more than he keeps, particularly to those who show respect for the dragons.\n\nHis latest hunt began two weeks ago, tracking reports of an unusually aggressive sky-shark disrupting trade routes near the Azure Cliffs. Rumors spoke of a strange, blackening corruption spreading across its hide – whispers that were dismissed as sailor’s tales until Velric saw it himself. The creature wasn't just attacking ships; it was *changing*, radiating heat even from miles away. He pursued it in his airship, “The Windshear,” a sturdy vessel built with salvaged dragon bone and reinforced sails, hoping to end the threat before it reached [[Galazeth]]. He’d faced corrupted beasts before, remnants of [[Ashqua]]'s influence leaking into Magda, but nothing like this.\n\nThe encounter was a maelstrom of chaos. The air crackled with heat as the corrupted sky-shark, now visibly wreathed in black fire, slammed into The Windshear. Velric remembers the sickening crunch of dragon bone splintering, the smell of ozone and burning oil filling his lungs, and the terrifying shriek of the beast echoing across the clouds. He fought back with harpoons tipped with azurite – a mineral known to disrupt corrupted energies – but they barely seemed to slow it down. The shark’s hide felt…wrong, not scaled like a normal sky-shark, but slick and burning, radiating an unnatural heat that threatened to melt his ship around him. A final, devastating blow tore through the Windshear's engine, sending it spiraling downwards towards the jagged peaks below.\n\nVelric barely survived, crash-landing in a remote ravine outside [[Galazeth]]. He’s now nursing broken ribs and a haunted look, recounting his tale to anyone who will listen. The wreckage of The Windshear is still smoldering, attracting scavengers and sparking rumors about a new breed of corrupted sky-sharks threatening the trade routes. He believes the creature was more than just corrupted; it felt *directed*, as if guided by something intelligent.\n\nThis could lead to several story hooks: players might be tasked with salvaging parts from The Windshear, investigating the source of the corruption (potentially linking back to [[Molten]] influence or a new cult), or even joining Velric on a renewed hunt for the creature, now believed to be heading towards [[First Light]]. Rumors in taverns could mention sightings of similar corrupted sharks, and merchants might offer rewards for information leading to their destruction. Velric himself could become a valuable source of information about sky-shark behavior and the dangers lurking beyond [[Galazeth]], offering guidance or even a modified harpoon blueprint as a reward for assistance."],[95,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Igni]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:20:55\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #Jake, #Hobgoblin, #Vendetta, #Crystalized, #Nerrath, #Mumblebeard, #Goals\n\n# Player Name; Jake\n\n**Aliases:**  \n**Race:**  Hobgoblin\n**Class/Occupation:**  \n**Age:**  \n**Gender:**  \n**Alignment:**  \n**Background:**  \n**Affiliations:**  \n[[Aurene Candra]], [[Din Strider]], [[Dren]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Mumblebeard]], [[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Theer]], [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] \n## 📝 Description  \nA brief physical and personality description.

Dimly lit and claustrophobic, Magda offers a unique atmosphere filled with workshops, hidden passages, and the scent of stone and metal. Adjacent to the city are specialized farms cultivating crops to nourish docile dragons – their fields often protected by small shrines honoring nature spirits. The architecture subtly incorporates elements reflecting the ancient dragon nesting sites found within the caves.\n\n- **Geographical location:** Carved within a network of caves and underground tunnels, situated _within_ the South East of [[Críoch Skolvar]]. The surrounding terrain is characterized by rocky landscapes, mineral-rich veins, and dragon farms.\n- **History and notable events:** Founded centuries ago around a nexus of natural energy within the caves, attracting druids and those who sought harmony with nature. The events of [[Moonfall]]forced evacuation from the corrupted [[Zonnewij Isels]] and [[Magda]]'s caves were a familiar haven for those of the subterranean refugees. The city’s growth is intertwined with the arrival of Dwarven refugees, bringing their stone working skills and reverence for the earth.\n- **Surrounding terrain and climate:** Primarily subterranean; humid and cool within the caves, with pockets of warmer air near geothermal vents. Above ground, a rugged landscape with sparse vegetation but thriving fungal forests nourished by mineral-rich runoff. Climate is temperate but prone to sudden shifts in weather due to its island location.\n- **Dominant race or ethnic group:** Dragonborn (40%), Dwarves (30%), Human (15%), other (15% – Gnomes, Halflings, and those drawn by the unique energies of the area).\n- [[Magda population]]: to be around **60-80** inhabitants.\n\n**Demographics:**\n\n- **Major social classes:** Artisans, [[Stone Wardens]] (those who maintain the cave systems), [[Lorekeepers]] (druids and scholars studying natural energies).

No longer truly human—or whatever they once were—they exist as **living embers of her wrath**, bound in eternal servitude to the imprisoned sun goddess.\r\n\r\n### **Transformation and Corruption**\r\n\r\nThe process of becoming Molten is not instantaneous. [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] influence **warps both flesh and spirit**, altering her victims in stages:\r\n\r\n- **Early Corruption**: Skin becomes feverishly hot, veins glow like smoldering coals, and the afflicted develop an unnatural resistance to fire. They begin hearing [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] whispers.\r\n- **Mid Corruption**: Hair burns away, flesh blackens and cracks, revealing molten light beneath. Their movements become erratic, driven by bursts of flame. They lose their identity, speaking only in [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] name.\r\n- **Complete Transformation**: The last shreds of their former selves are burned away. Their bodies become **charred husks of obsidian and molten rock**, their eyes searing like miniature suns. They no longer think—only obey.\r\n\r\n### **Physical Appearance**\r\n\r\nMolten beings vary depending on the depth of their corruption. Some retain **humanoid silhouettes**, while others have melted into **unrecognizable forms of flowing magma and charred bone**. The most powerful among them become **pure living flame**, shedding all traces of a solid form.\r\n\r\n### **Types of Molten**\r\n\r\n- **[[Molten Thralls]]** – Newly turned, still bearing remnants of their former selves. Their flesh is cracked and burning, but they retain vague memories, making them hesitant in battle.\r\n- **[[Blazing Husks]]** – Fully transformed warriors of [[Ashqua]], their bodies reduced to little more than charred frames filled with molten energy. They explode upon death.\r\n- **[[Infernal Stalkers]]** – Faster, more agile Molten that leave fiery footprints as they hunt. Their claws can ignite the air itself.\r\n- **[[Molten Titans]]** – Towering monstrosities that radiate unbearable heat. They wield weapons of molten metal and leave rivers of fire in their wake.\r\n- **[[Ashbound Priests]]** – Those who willingly gave themselves to[[Ashqua]], now her prophets of flame. They channel her divine fire into devastating rituals.\r\n\r\n### **Behavior and Combat Tactics**\r\n\r\nMolten do not feel pain or fear. They attack **relentlessly, spreading flame wherever they tread**. Some **burn out quickly in violent bursts**, while others smolder slowly, enduring strikes that would fell mortal warriors. Their presence alone **warps the battlefield**, causing metal to soften, wood to ignite, and the air to shimmer with heat.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Shade]]\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]"],[60,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Moonfall]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:20:29\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, keywords/short, phrases, extracted, text, suitable, tags:, 1., Crown, Day, Break, 2., Moon, Crash, 3., New, Solar, Republic, 4., Moonlight, Monarchy, 5., Primal, Energy, Corruption, 6., Zonnewij, Isels, 7., Celestial, Imbalance\n\n## Date\n\nUnknown, but in the current era\n\n## Summary\n\nThe [[Crown of Day Break]] was accidentally activated, causing the moon to crash into the land.

Before her sacrifice, she wore robes of flowing midnight blue, embroidered with constellations that shifted like the night sky.\n\nWip appearance image\n![[Nagissia idea.jpg]]\n## Personality\n\nOnce a warm and nurturing ruler, Nerrath grew sorrowful and distant after the war against [[Ashqua]].

These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.\n- **Oath of Redemption Paladin**: The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers. While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.\n## History\n\nNerrath ascended alongside her sister, [[Ashqua]], thanks to the aid of the [[Unwritten]]. As ruler of the Night Kingdom, she maintained the balance between day and night. However, as [[Ashqua]] descended into tyranny, Nerrath fought to preserve the world's equilibrium, leading to [[The Eclipse Wars]]**.\n\nDuring the War of the Infinite Eclipse, Nerrath fought against her sister, [[Ashqua]], to restore balance. After [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] fall, Nerrath agreed to the **United Mortal Pact**, a solemn agreement between her, the ancient dragons, and the mortals.\n## Relationships\n\n- **[[Ashqua]] (Sister, Goddess of the Sun):** Once beloved, now a fallen adversary sealed away.\n    \n- **The [[Unwritten]]:** Aiding force in her ascension, but now silent.\n    \n- **The [[Lunar Court]]:** A group of devoted followers who seek to maintain her legacy.\n## Trivia\n\n- It is said that when the moon is at its fullest, Nerrath’s whispers can be heard in the wind.\n\n- Her scattered essence manifests as luminous, ghostly figures known as Moon Shades.\n\n- Some believe that if [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] seal weakens, Nerrath’s power will return in full.\n\n\n\n## **The Lost Fragments of Nerrath**\n\nThough her body was gone, **Nerrath was not truly dead.**\n\nHer essence **was divided into five sacred relics**, each containing a part of her divine power:\n\n- **The Eyes of Nerrath** – Granting foresight and the ability to see into the dreams of mortals.\n- **The Mouth of Nerrath** – A voice of prophecy, speaking forgotten truths.\n- **The Heart of Nerrath** – A beacon of balance, pulsing with lunar power.\n- **The Body of Nerrath** – An unbreakable vessel, containing the strength of her divine will.\n- **The Head of Nerrath** – Holding the last fragments of her godly intellect and wisdom.\n\nEach piece is **an artifact of immense power**, but together, they hold an even greater secret: **if all five are found, Nerrath could return.** She would no longer be bound to the divine realm. She could **walk the mortal world once more.**\n\n## Backlinks\n- [[Igni]]\n- [[Mumblebeard]]\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]\n- [[Ashqua]]\n- [[Iheen's Grand Library]]\n- [[Lunar Dominion]]\n- [[Narazir's Personal Lab]]\n- [[Shade]]\n- [[The Lunar Pact]]\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\n- [[The Final Eclipse]]\n- [[Work On this Later]]\n- [[Brigid]]\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]"],[40,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Nethroi]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 16:23:49\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n![[Nethroi.png]]\nA town built around hot springs with purported healing properties.

He began preparing the tea, the scent of calming herbs filling the small space.\n\n“Troubled sleep, I presume?” Hemlock asked, his tone gentle. Elara nodded, running a hand through her tangled hair. “The whispers…they’re getting louder. About things in the caves.”\n\nHemlock chuckled, a dry rasping sound. \"Ah, yes. Old Man Tiber has been at it again.\" He gestured with a gnarled finger towards a hunched figure huddled near the hearth, stirring a murky liquid in a chipped mug. “Tiber Stonefist. Claims to have seen… _changes_ in the wildlife beyond the dragon farms. Mutated creatures, he says. Twisted by something dark.”\n\nElara frowned. \"I've heard him before. He’s always been prone to exaggeration.\"\n\n“Perhaps,” Hemlock conceded, placing her tea before her. “But Tiber isn’t malicious. Just… lonely. Lost his son years ago in a cave-in while mining azurite. Now he spends his days wandering the outskirts, claiming to see signs and omens. He says the creatures are growing bolder, more _wrong_. That their eyes glow with an unnatural light.”\n\nHemlock leaned closer, lowering his voice. “He claims they’re not just animals anymore. That something is… influencing them. Something old and hungry.\" He paused, studying Elara's face. \"He says the corruption started after the debris from Moonfall settled, seeping into the earth like a poison.”\n\nElara took a sip of her tea, its calming effects doing little to soothe her unease. “And you believe him?”\n\nHemlock shrugged. “I’ve lived long enough to know that even the wildest tales often have a grain of truth. Tiber isn't seeking attention; he seems genuinely frightened. He says he saw one – a rat, but… _different_. Pale and twitching, with holes burned through its fur as if touched by sunlight in the dark.”\n\nHe glanced towards Tiber, who was now staring intently into his mug, muttering under his breath about “shadows” and “awakening”. Hemlock sighed. \"Pay him no mind unless you start seeing things yourself. But… keep your eyes open, Elara. The caves have always held secrets. And some secrets are best left undisturbed.\"\n\nThe story establishes Tiber as a lonely, grieving man whose motivations stem from personal loss rather than malice. It casts doubt on his claims while simultaneously hinting at the possibility of something truly unsettling happening in the caves. His description of the mutated rat aligns with the notes about the corrupted wildlife and introduces the idea that Moonfall might be connected to the disturbances. The ending leaves Elara (and potentially the players) with a sense of unease and encourages further investigation."],[79,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Orin Talonsbane]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:01\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #AArakocra, #Paladin, #HauntedOne, #NewSolarRepublic, #BlossomVale, #ShatteredIsles\n\n# Player Name: Andrew\n\n**Aliases:**  \n**Race:**  AArakocra\n**Class/Occupation:**  Paladin\n**Age:**  23\n**Gender:**  Male\n**Alignment:**  [[Chaotic Neutral]]\n**Background:**  Haunted One\n**Affiliations:**  \n[[Aurene Candra]], [[Din Strider]], [[Dren]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Mumblebeard]], [[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Theer]], [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] \n## 📝 Description  \n\n![[Pasted image 20250210001812.png]]\n## 🎭 Personality  \n\n## 🏹 Abilities & Skills  \n\n## ⚔️ Equipment  \n\n## 📖 History  \n\n\n## 🧩 Relationships  \n- **Allies:** (Friends, family, mentors)  Family is all dead except for an ageing uncle\n- **Rivals/Enemies:** (Who opposes them and why?)  \n\n## 🏔️ Locations Associated  \n- **Hometown:**  [[New Solar Republic]], [[First Light]], [[Blossom Vale]]\n- **Frequented Places:**  \n\n## 🎭 Notable Quotes  \n> \"A quote that represents the character.\"\n\n## 🏆 Goals & Motivations  \n- **Short-Term Goals:**  Gain Strength and learn how to gamble\n- **Long-Term Goals:**  Learn the History of [[The Shattered Isles]]\n\n## 🗂️ Notes & Trivia  \n- Fun facts, inspirations, or additional details.  \n\n---\n**Tags:** `#character #DND` (or adjust for your system)  \n\n\n## Related Notes\n- [[Felladrian]]\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]\n- [[Mumblebeard]]\n- [[Aurene Candra]]\n\n## Backlinks\n- [[Aurene Candra]]\n- [[Din Strider]]\n- [[Dren]]\n- [[Felladrian]]\n- [[Flux]]\n- [[Igni]]\n- [[Mumblebeard]]\n- [[Narazir]]\n- [[Okami]]\n- [[Player Characters Season 2]]\n- [[Theer]]\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]"],[128,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Outline]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:28:33\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n(cont'd) ## Related Notes\n- [[Brigid]]\n\n## Backlinks\n- [[Magda]]"],[127,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Outline]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:28:33\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n(cont'd) This is just a starting point, of course.

A level 1-5 arc culminating in acquiring the “Star” provides a clear goal. Here’s a plan for your first campaign chapter, broken down into stages with note organization suggestions:\n\n**Overall Chapter Theme:** *Uncovering the Truth & Containing the Threat* – The party starts as relatively unaware investigators and gradually pieces together the puzzle of Ashqua's awakening while attempting to mitigate the immediate consequences.\n\n**I. Initial Investigation (Levels 1-2): \"Whispers in the Caves\"**\n\n*   **Starting Point:** Magda is experiencing increased tremors, strange animal behavior, and unsettling rumors. The party begins as locals or travelers drawn into the situation.\n*   **Initial Quest:** A request from [[Elder Brynjar]] (or a local authority) to investigate reports of unusual activity in the caves near dragon farms. Farmers are reporting their dragons becoming agitated and even aggressive.\n*   **Key Locations:** Dragon Farms, outskirts of Magda, initial cave entrances.\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   Agitated Dragons (low-level combat). Focus on non-lethal solutions initially – calming the beasts rather than killing them.\n    *   Strange creatures emerging from tunnels (e.g., mutated wildlife affected by Ashqua’s energy).\n    *   A hidden shrine dedicated to nature spirits, defiled or corrupted.\n*   **Clues:**\n    *   Evidence of strange energy fluctuations detected by [[Lorekeepers]].\n    *   Reports of a “red glow” emanating from deeper within the caves.\n    *   Whispers about the old legends of Ashqua and the sealed prison.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Detailed descriptions of Dragon Farms & initial cave entrances.\n    *   Stat blocks for low-level creatures and agitated dragons.\n    *   NPC profiles: [[Elder Brynjar]], concerned farmers, a local herbalist who provides clues about the defiled shrine.\n    *   A \"Rumors\" section listing what locals are saying.\n\n**II. Deeper Descent (Levels 2-3): “Echoes of the Past”**\n\n*   **Quest Expansion:** The party discovers that the disturbances aren’t natural and begin to investigate the history of Magda and its connection to Ashqua.\n*   **Key Locations:** [[Glimmering Grotto]], [[Heartstone Chamber]] (seeking information from council members), deeper sections of the caves, potentially the [[Echoing Chasm]].\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   Cultists attempting to sabotage investigations or harness Ashqua’s power.\n    *   Cave-ins and treacherous terrain within the tunnels.\n    *   Guardians protecting ancient secrets (e.g., animated stone constructs).\n*   **Clues:**\n    *   Ancient texts in [[Heartstone Chamber]] revealing details about Ashqua's imprisonment and the “Star.”\n    *   Discovering a hidden chamber containing remnants of the United Mortal Pact that sealed Ashqua away.\n    *   Finding evidence of the High Priestess [[Ayzat]]’s manipulation of Ashqua.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Detailed descriptions of key locations within Magda (Grotto, Chamber, Chasm).\n    *   Stat blocks for cultists and guardians.\n    *   NPC profiles: Council members, [[Torvin Stonebeard]] providing warnings about cave stability.\n    *   Excerpts from ancient texts detailing Ashqua’s history.\n\n**III. The Source (Levels 3-4): “The Vein of Azurite”**\n\n*   **Quest Focus:** Following clues leads the party to the [[Vein of Azurite]], where they discover the artifact – the \"Star\" – is weakening and Ashqua’s influence is strongest.\n*   **Key Locations:** The [[Vein of Azurite]], surrounding tunnels, potentially a hidden chamber containing remnants of the sealing ritual.\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   More powerful cultists guarding the Star.\n    *   Creatures fully corrupted by Ashqua’s energy (e.g., molten elementals).\n    *   A challenging puzzle or obstacle protecting the artifact.\n*   **Clues:**\n    *   Discovering that the “Star” isn't just a seal but also a source of power for Ashqua, and its weakening is accelerating her awakening.\n    *   Learning about the [[Unwritten]]’s role in both Ashqua’s ascension and potential escape.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Detailed description of the [[Vein of Azurite]] and surrounding area.\n    *   Stat blocks for corrupted creatures and powerful cultists.\n    *   Puzzle design for protecting the artifact.\n\n**IV. Securing the Star (Level 5): “A Fragile Victory”**\n\n*   **Climax:** The party must secure the \"Star\" and attempt to reinforce its seal, facing a final confrontation with Ashqua’s forces.\n*   **Key Locations:** [[Vein of Azurite]], potentially a collapsing section of the caves as Ashqua's power grows.\n*   **Encounters:**\n    *   A powerful boss encounter – perhaps a corrupted champion of Ashqua or a creature empowered by her energy.\n    *   A desperate attempt to stabilize the seal on the Star, requiring skill checks and teamwork.\n*   **Outcome:** The party successfully secures the \"Star,\" but it’s clear that Ashqua is still far from defeated. They have bought time, but the threat remains.\n*   **Notes to Create/Organize:**\n    *   Stat block for the final boss encounter.\n    *   Detailed description of the collapsing caves and the urgency of the situation.\n    *   Rules for reinforcing the seal on the Star (skill checks, resource expenditure).\n\n**V. Chapter Wrap-Up:**\n\n*   The party returns to Magda as heroes, but with a sense of foreboding.\n*   They’ve learned about Ashqua's history, her motivations, and the looming threat she poses.\n*   This sets the stage for future chapters focused on finding ways to permanently defeat Ashqua or prepare for her inevitable return.\n\n**Organization Tips:**\n\n*   **Dedicated Notes:** Create separate notes for each key location, NPC, creature, and clue.\n*   **Linking:** Use Obsidian’s linking feature extensively to connect related information.\n*   **Tags:** Tag notes with relevant keywords\n*   **Timeline:** Create a timeline of events leading up to the campaign and during the first chapter."],[122,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Party]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/05/05 01:08:58\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/05 02:20:42\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\nParty starts their Journey at the Renewal Festival in [[Magda]]\n\nAlex: [[Eldar Grelamin]]\nAndrew: [[Jord]]\nEric: [[Ben Ravencroft]]\nJake: [[Hallar]]\nMark:[[Rexx]]\nNate: [[Lucky Folais]]\nZakk: [[Skarhn]]"],[78,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Player Characters Season 2]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:19\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Din, Strider, Halfling, Barbarian/Monk, Folk, Hero, Chaotic, Good, Affiliations, Aurene, Candra\n\n[[Aurene Candra]]  \n[[Din Strider]]  \n[[Dren]]  \n[[Felladrian]]  \n[[Flux]]  \n[[Igni]]  \n[[Mumblebeard]]  \n[[Narazir]]  \n[[Okami]]  \n[[Orin Talonsbane]]  \n[[Theer]]  \n[[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]"],[77,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Porkery Buns]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 17:13:51\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, relevant, tags, extracted, provided, text:, 1., Arakrokra, 2., Magda, 3., Glimmering, Grotto, 4., Dragon, farming, 5., Mineral, extraction, 6., Artisans, 7., Jewelry/weapons, crafting\n\nBusiness' run by and arakrokra\n\n## Related Notes\n- [[Magda]]\n- [[Establishments of Interest in Magda]]\n- [[Brigid]]\n- [[Magda]]\n\n## Backlinks\n- [[Flux]]"],[116,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Rexx]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/05/05 02:19:54\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/05 02:31:23\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\nrace leonin ranger\n\nboon:Lunar Veil: Passive+2 Light while in stealth.

The party will be tasked by [Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar) to investigate initial reports, leading them into the caves where they’ll encounter their first challenges – both combat and clues – hinting at a larger threat.\n\n**Scene Breakdown:**\n\n1. **Arrival in Magda (30-45 mins):** Players arrive in [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md), either as locals or travelers. Focus on establishing the atmosphere described in the note: labyrinthine city, stone & metal scent, dragon farms nearby. Introduce key locations like the [Glimmering Grotto](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FGlimmering%20Grotto.md) and potentially [The Root & Vine](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FThe%20Root%20%26%20Vine.md).\n2. **Brynjar’s Request (30 mins):** Players are summoned to meet with [[Elder Brynjar]], who explains the growing unrest among the dragons and requests their assistance in investigating the caves near the dragon farms. This is where the initial quest is given: investigate reports of agitated dragons.\n3. **Dragon Farm Investigation (45-60 mins):** The party visits a nearby dragon farm, interacting with concerned farmers and witnessing firsthand the agitated state of the dragons. They gather clues about strange behavior and potentially encounter a minor incident – a frightened [[Root Drake]] nearly breaking free.\n4. **Cave Entrance & Initial Exploration (60-90 mins):** Players enter the caves near the farms. This scene focuses on exploration, description, and a first combat encounter. The goal is to introduce the unsettling atmosphere of the caves and hint at something amiss.\n\n**Encounters:**\n\n- **Agitated Dragon (Non-Lethal Focus):** A young, frightened dragon (use stats for a very young/small dragon – perhaps reskinning a wolf or large dog stat block) that is agitated but not actively malicious. The encounter should focus on calming the dragon rather than fighting it. Success could involve skill checks (Animal Handling, Persuasion) and offering soothing herbs from [Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock).\n- **[[Mutated Wildlife]] (Combat):** 2-3 mutated creatures affected by Ashqua’s energy (reskin rats or bats with slightly increased stats and a creepy appearance). This is the first combat encounter – keep it simple and manageable for level 1 characters. Focus on establishing that something _is_ wrong, not necessarily a full-blown threat.\n- **Hidden Shrine (Investigation):** A small shrine dedicated to nature spirits, defiled or corrupted with strange symbols. Requires investigation skill checks to uncover clues about the corruption.\n\n**Roleplay & NPCs:**\n\n- **[Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar):** Portray her as wise and concerned, but also hesitant to jump to conclusions. She should emphasize the importance of understanding the situation before resorting to violence. Focus on her connection to nature and dragons.\n- **Farmers:** Play them as stressed and worried about their livelihood. They can provide rumors about the “red glow” in the caves and whispers of old legends.\n- **[Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock):** A source of local lore and herbal remedies. He can offer clues about the defiled shrine and suggest calming herbs for the dragons.\n\n**Hooks & Momentum:**\n\nEnd the session with a cliffhanger: While exploring deeper into the caves, the party discovers evidence of a hidden chamber or tunnel leading further down. They also find a strange energy fluctuation detected by their equipment (or a character’s intuition). This sets up Session 2's exploration of “Deeper Descent.”\n\n**Prep Work:**\n\n- **Maps:** Sketch out a simple map of [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) and the surrounding dragon farms, as well as a basic cave layout for the initial exploration area.\n- **Creature Stat Blocks:** Prepare stat blocks for the agitated dragon (reskinned), mutated wildlife, and any other creatures you anticipate encountering.\n- **NPC Profiles:** Flesh out brief profiles for [Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar), farmers, and [Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock). Include key personality traits and dialogue prompts.\n- **Handouts:** Consider a simple handout with rumors circulating in [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) or a map of the dragon farms.\n- **Skill Check Lists:** Have a list of relevant skill checks prepared for each scene (e.g., Animal Handling, Persuasion, Investigation).\n\n  \n###Tldr lolz\n*   Players arrive in Magda, a labyrinthine city with nearby dragon farms, and are introduced to the setting.\n*   Elder Brynjar tasks the party with investigating reports of unrest among dragons near the farms.\n*   The investigation leads to a dragon farm where they witness agitated dragons and gather clues.\n*   Players explore caves near the farms, encountering their first combat (mutated wildlife) and a non-lethal encounter with a frightened young dragon.\n*   A defiled shrine is discovered within the caves, hinting at corruption and requiring investigation skill checks.\n*   The session ends on a cliffhanger – discovery of a hidden chamber/tunnel and detection of strange energy fluctuations.\n*   Key NPCs include Elder Brynjar (wise & concerned), stressed farmers, and Old Man Hemlock (lore source).\n*   Prep work includes maps, creature stat blocks, NPC profiles, handouts, and skill check lists."],[112,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Session 3 Garden of Bones Notes]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/06/16 00:32:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/06/16 14:44:58\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\nparty starts with a short rest\n\nduring the short rest [[Eldar Grelamin]] cooks some eyeball mushroom he gathered when meeting [[Rexx]] was a good check i let him make 1 snack for each member of the party if eaten it will restore 1 hit and eyeball mushroom have a con save dc 12 vs shroom vision object start buzzing/ melting into each other -10 to all checks and or save relying on sight, on a Nat 1 you become addicted gain 1 point of exhaustion per rest with out the eye ball mushroom gains true sight for 1 min.

Loot & Rewards\n* **Spiderdragon Remains:** Chitin, venom sacs, fiery glands (valuable for crafting fire resistance potions, special weapons).\n* **Hoard:** Nestled among the webs, perhaps in a cooler crevice:\n    * Modest coins and gems (fire opals, obsidian).\n    * A magic item: e.g., a *Cloak of Protection* (singed but functional) or a *Ring of Warmth*.\n    * **Crucial Clue:** A **Molten Orb** (fist-sized, pulsating obsidian sphere, unnaturally hot) or a fragmented **Obsidian Tablet** with strange, glowing runes. This is a direct link to the source of corruption.\n\n### 2. The Source of Corruption: The Twisted Heart of the Garden\nAt the very heart of the shrine, likely where the spiderdragon nested, lies the true source of Magda's irregularities:\n* **The Desecrated Altar/Heartstone:** A glowing, pulsating mass of **obsidian and crystalline bone**, embedded in the earth or atop a crude altar, constantly oozing fresh molten corruption. Around it, the bone-plants are densest and most unnaturally vibrant.\n* **The Irregularities (Possible Effects in Magda):**\n    * **Minor Mutations:** Farm animals developing strange growths or aggressive tendencies.\n    * **Environmental Blight:** Patches of plant life dying or becoming twisted and carnivorous.\n    * **Psychological Effects:** Strange nightmares, increased paranoia, or unusual fevers among townsfolk.\n    * **Temporal Flux:** Minor time distortions, objects appearing or disappearing briefly.\n\n### 3. Post-Combat Discoveries\nInteracting with the Molten Heartstone/Altar could trigger:\n* A sudden **flash of disturbing images:** A forgotten ritual, ancient figures, a sacrifice, or a dark power being unleashed.\n* A **wave of psychic feedback:** Filling their minds with fragmented whispers, perhaps sounding like verses from \"Garden of Bones.\"\n* A **horrific realization:** The shrine is actively *absorbing* something (life force, sanity, time) from the area, twisting it into the molten blight.\n* **Further Clues:** Find offerings around the altar (tarnished religious artifacts, strange symbols) or a **journal/scroll** detailing the shrine's purpose and its connection to Magda. This journal could explicitly name the \"Garden of Bones\" or the ritual.\n\n---\n\n## Post-Session Questions for Players\n* \"What do you do now that the spiderdragon is defeated?\"\n* \"Do you try to investigate the source of this molten energy further, or do you head back to the farms to report what you've found?\"\n* \"What are your characters feeling/thinking after this encounter?\""],[123,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Session 3 Garden of Bones]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/06/15 20:30:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/06/16 14:35:29\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n# Quest: The Garden of Bones Shrine\n\n## Current Situation\nThe party is exploring a branch of caves past the farms. They have encountered mutated wildlife and a CR 6 spiderdragon corrupted by molten energy. The spiderdragon, having been fought, has fled, and the party is believed to be chasing it.\n\n**New Information:** The spiderdragon is nesting in a **hidden shrine** that is the source of the \"molten corruption\" and the irregularities around the town of Magda. The shrine's atmosphere and visuals will be heavily inspired by the song \"Garden of Bones\" by Galdorcraeft.\n\n---\n\n## Session Goal\n* The party successfully tracks the injured spiderdragon.\n* They engage the spiderdragon in a final confrontation within its lair, the \"Garden of Bones\" shrine.\n* They discover the true nature of the shrine as the source of Magda's irregularities.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: The Chase Through the Corrupted Caves\n\nThe spiderdragon is wounded and fleeing, aiming to reach the sanctuary of its lair – the hidden shrine.\n\n### 1. Setting the Scene\n* **Recap:** Remind players of the spiderdragon's escape and their pursuit.\n* **Sensory Details:** Emphasize the escalating heat, the pervasive smell of ozone and sulfur, and the constant chittering of unseen, molten-corrupted wildlife. The air grows thick and heavy. As they go deeper, the natural caves begin to give way to something unnatural.\n\n### 2. The Chase Mechanics (Skill Challenge)\nPresent a series of obstacles requiring different skills over 3-5 \"rounds\" of chase. Successes gain ground; failures lead to minor setbacks or hazards.\n\n* **Round 1: Tracking/Navigation**\n    * **Challenge:** The caves branch frequently; the spiderdragon tries to obscure its path.\n    * **Skills:** DC 13-15 Wisdom (Survival) to follow tracks, or DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) to spot subtle clues (molten scorch marks, shed chitin).\n    * **Outcome:** Success means gaining ground. Failure means losing ground or taking a longer, more dangerous path.\n\n* **Round 2: Environmental Hazard - Molten Pools**\n    * **Challenge:** A chamber crisscrossed by glowing, bubbling streams of molten rock.\n    * **Skills:** DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to jump/balance, or DC 13 Strength (Athletics) to navigate.\n    * **Outcome:** Failure risks 1d6-2d6 fire damage and/or being slowed.\n\n* **Round 3: Corrupted Wildlife Ambush/Distraction**\n    * **Challenge:** The spiderdragon kicks down a cluster of pulsating, molten-corrupted bats (use *Swarm of Bats* stat block, +1 fire damage per hit, glow) or stirs up mutated centipedes.\n    * **Skills:** Quick combat encounter (1-2 rounds) against minor threats, or DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) to slip past.\n    * **Outcome:** Distraction causes time loss or minor damage.\n\n* **Round 4: Obstacle - Dense, Glowing Webs**\n    * **Challenge:** Passages choked with thick, superheated, obsidian-like webbing.\n    * **Skills:** DC 14 Strength (Athletics) to tear through, or DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to find weak points.\n    * **Outcome:** Contact with webs deals 1d4 fire damage. Failure risks entanglement.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: The Spiderdragon's Lair - The Garden of Bones Shrine\n\nThe chase culminates in a distinct, unnaturally carved cavern system: the \"Garden of Bones\" shrine.\n\n### 1. Lair Description\n* **Appearance:** This vast, unnaturally carved chamber is lit by the oppressive, intense orange/red glow from numerous fissures and bubbling molten pools. Jagged stalactites drip not water, but slow beads of liquid fire. The air shimmers with heat, thick with the smell of sulfur, ozone, and something metallic, like hot blood and rust.\n* **The \"Garden\":** The most striking feature. The floor and lower walls are choked with a horrific forest of **molten-infused skeletal remains.** These bones are fused into the rock, standing upright like grotesque, glowing plants. Some are humanoid, others monstrous, all dripping with slow beads of molten ichor.\n* **Lyrical Integration (Visual/Atmosphere):**\n    * \"This is the **Garden of Bones**, where shadows dance and memories cease.\" (Describe distorted light, unsettling aura).\n    * \"From the **ash and dust**, new horrors bloom in silent, grim embrace.\" (Emphasize the twisted life and decay).\n    * \"The ground itself is **cold and stark**, a tapestry of graves.\" (Despite heat, sense of pervasive death).\n* **Aural Cues:** The hiss and pop of cooling lava, distant earth rumbling, and faint, melancholic whispers or discordant moans seemingly emanating from the skeletal growths.\n* **Hazards:**\n    * **Molten Patches:** Any creature entering a molten patch space takes 2d6 fire damage.\n    * **Molten Webs:** Webs are difficult terrain. Anyone moving through or touching them takes 1d4 fire damage. Breaking them requires a DC 12 Strength check or fire damage.\n\n### 2. The Spiderdragon's Role & Tactics\nThe young spiderdragon is a product and protector of the shrine's corruption, likely more aggressive and heavily mutated.\n* **Elevated Threat:** Consider a minor boost (a few more HP, a legendary resistance, or an additional \"Molten Burst\" area attack) to reflect its connection to the shrine.\n* **Tactics:** It will use the bone growths and molten streams for cover and strategic attacks, spitting corrosive venom/molten webbing, and attempting to push characters into hazards. It defends its \"garden\" fiercely.\n* **Optional Minions:** 1-2 \"Molten Spiders\" (reskin *Giant Spiders*: bite deals 1d4 bonus fire damage, web is sticky + 1d4 fire damage on contact) emerge, drawn by the conflict.\n\n### 3. The Final Confrontation\nMake the fight cinematic, leveraging the shrine's environment. Describe its molten-infused attacks and movements.\n\n---"],[73,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Shade]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Lunar, warriors, Nerrath's, sorrow, Shadow, frost, essence, Violent, resurgence, Frozen, armor, Spectral, mist, Undying\r\n\r\n### **Shade**\r\n\r\nShades are the **cursed revenants of the Lunar warriors**, reborn through [[Nerrath|Nerrath's]] sorrow and defiance. Forged from **shadow, frost, and the lingering essence of the fallen**, they exist as a counterforce to [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] blazing [[Molten]]. Neither living nor truly dead, they are spectral remnants, **cloaked in cold mist and bound by an undying will to fight**.\r\n\r\n### **Transformation and Creation**\r\n\r\nUnlike the [[Molten]], who are consumed by fire and corruption, Shades are created through **[[Nerrath|Nerrath's]] embrace of darkness and ice**. The process is not one of slow decay but **a violent resurgence**—a soul called back from death, reshaped into something both haunting and unnatural.\r\n\r\n- **Death and Rebirth** – When a warrior falls under the moon’s gaze, their lingering spirit is drawn into the cold mist. If they are deemed worthy, ice and shadow knit them back together.\r\n- **Body of Frost and Void** – Shades are no longer bound by flesh. Their forms are **half-substantial**, shifting between **frozen armor and spectral mist**, their bodies always on the edge of dissolving into shadow.\r\n- **Mind of Echoes** – Shades retain fragments of their former selves, but their emotions are dulled, their thoughts distant whispers. They exist for one purpose: to oppose the Molten and maintain balance in the eternal war of fire and ice.\r\n\r\n### **Physical Appearance**\r\n\r\nShades vary in form, shaped by the strength of their spirit and the depth of their connection to [[Nerrath]]. Some still resemble **armored warriors**, their bodies rimed with frost, while others **have lost all shape**, appearing only as shifting, jagged silhouettes of shadow and cold.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient among them are **nothing but void and frost**, faceless specters with glowing, ice-blue eyes—**ghosts of a war that never truly ended**.\r\n\r\n### **Types of Shades**\r\n\r\n- **[[Mistborn Stalkers]]** – Fast-moving hunters that flicker in and out of sight, striking from the fog before vanishing again.\r\n- **[[Frostbound Husks]]** – Heavy, armored Shades with jagged ice blades. Their presence saps the warmth from the air, freezing enemies solid.\r\n- **[[Wraithborn Knights]]** – Ethereal warriors wielding weapons of solid moonlight, striking with precision before dissolving into mist.\r\n- **[[Void-Touched Reapers]]** – Beings of pure shadow and ice, leaving behind trails of absolute cold. They consume heat itself, turning the battlefield into a frozen graveyard.\r\n- **[[Shroudcallers]]** – Shades who have transcended physical form, manipulating the battlefield by summoning spectral frost and unnatural darkness.\r\n\r\n### **Behavior and Combat Tactics**\r\n\r\nShades **do not march—they drift, they whisper, they strike from the mist**. Their battles are not **raging infernos**, but **cold, methodical engagements** where the air itself turns against their enemies. They **sap heat, extinguish flames, and drain the will to fight**, their presence alone enough to frost weapons and still beating hearts.\r\n\r\nWhile [[Molten]] charge with reckless fury, Shades prefer to **isolate, weaken, and consume**. A battlefield overtaken by Shades is eerily **silent**, save for the crackling of ice and the distant echoes of the dead.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]\r\n- [[Lunar Dominion]]\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n- [[Naya]]\r\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]"],[21,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Silberkamm Isles]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 14:28:43\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\nIsland name inspiration: \"Silber\" (silver, associated with the moon) and \"Kamm\" (ridge or crest), suggesting shimmering, moonlit peaks or coastlines.\n![[Pasted image 20250209165641.png]]\nCities and towns\n1.

The land itself became a canvas of destruction: rivers of fire, jagged mountains of ice, and skies illuminated by the conflicting might of day and night. The mortals, caught in the crossfire, sought refuge, only to find themselves enslaved by the warring powers.\r\n\r\n[[The Lunar Pact]]\r\nAs the conflict escalated, [[Nerrath]] saw the true cost of her fight. [[Ashqua]]'s paranoia had not only consumed her but also threatened to destroy everything else. The ancient dragons, once wise stewards of the world, made a choice: they sacrificed their intellect, becoming beasts of war. Mortals, desperate for survival, bound themselves to primal powers, giving them the strength to oppose the godswars.\r\n\r\nIn this time of desperation, [[The Lunar Pact]] was forged—a fragile alliance between Nerrath, the dragons, and mortals. Together, they sought to end the war before it consumed everything.\r\n\r\n[[The Final Eclipse]]\r\nThe battle for [[The Shattered Isles]] reached its zenith. [[Ashqua]]'s [[Molten]] armies clashed with [[Nerrath]]'s [[Shade]]—spectral warriors of ice and shadow. The battlefield was a stark contrast: the [[Molten]], radiant and fierce, against the [[Shade]]s, ethereal and cold, their presence sapping heat from the earth.\r\n\r\n[[Nerrath]] led the charge, her [[Lunar Dominion]] a calming force amidst the flames. She moved with grace, her mind guided by the stars, seeking to restore balance. Yet [[Ashqua]], consumed by fear, would not relent. The war raged on, each side pushing the other to the brink of collapse.\r\n\r\nIn a climactic clash, [[Nerrath]] confronted [[Ashqua]], her [[Lunar Dominion]] flaring with cold light. The conflict was not just physical but emotional—a battle of wills, where each sister fought for what they believed was right.\r\n\r\nThe Tragic Victory\r\n[[Ashqua]]'s fear of losing control led her to a dark truth: this world must burn. \r\nYet Nerrath's unwavering resolve shone brighter than Ashqua's tyranny. In their final encounter, Nerrath sacrifices herself to weaken Ashqua's hold, her essence scattering across the Badlands as Moon Shades—a haunting reminder of her strength.\r\n\r\nThe war ended with a bittersweet truce. The Lunar Pact sealed Ashqua away within the Dyson Sphere, her godly might trapped but not destroyed. Nerrath's sacrifice bought the world a temporary peace, though it came at great cost.\r\n\r\nThe Aftermath\r\nThe Shattered Isles lay in ruins, their landscapes scarred by the war's aftermath. The Lunar Court emerged, carrying Nerrath's legacy, determined to protect balance. Ashqua, imprisoned, became a fearsome legend—a tale of cautionary tales about the dangers of unchecked power.\r\n\r\nYet the world was changed forever. The mortals, bound by the Lunar Pact, learned the true weight of their actions. They carried the scars of war, not just in their land but in their hearts, forever remembering the sisters who gave everything for a chance at peace.\r\n\r\nThe Eclipse Wars marked the end of an era, leaving behind a world on the edge of rebuilding. The Shattered Isles would one day rise again, but the lessons of that war would linger, a reminder of the thin line between light and shadow.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n- [[The Lunar Pact]]\r\n- [[The Tale of the Shattering]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]\r\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]"],[68,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Final Eclipse]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Ashqua, Nerrath, (sisters/opposing, forces), [[Shattered, Isles]], Crown, Day, Break, Unwritten, Solar, Dominion, Frozen, Moonlight, Eternal, Day, Lunar, Dominion\r\n\r\nThe war had reached its breaking point. [[Ashqua]]’s fire had consumed the land, [[Nerrath]]’s frost had swallowed the sky, and the battlefield stood divided between searing radiance and unyielding night. The sisters, once bound by love, now faced each other as opposing forces in a war of gods.\r\n\r\nBut only one of them understood the **true stakes.**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]], crowned in fire, stood at the precipice of revelation. She had seen the truth—the world **was meant to end.** [[The Shattered Isles]], the war, the suffering—all of it should have faded into oblivion. Yet something held it together, defying fate itself. **The [[Unwritten]].**\r\n\r\n\"This world is a wound in the fabric of existence,\" [[Ashqua]] declared, her **[[Crown of Day Break]]** blazing like a second sun. \"It refuses to die. It lingers. It festers. If I do not burn it away, the corruption will spread beyond our world—to the very heart of the multiverse.\"\r\n\r\nBut [[Nerrath]] would not accept this. \"Perhaps the world was meant to end,\" she admitted.\r\n\"You would see them suffer for eternity,\" [[Ashqua]] said, voice heavy with sorrow.\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong,\" [[Nerrath]] whispered. \"This tale is not finished it still lives. And as long as it does, I will protect it.\"\r\n\r\nThere would be no compromise.\r\n\r\nAnd so, they fought.\r\n\r\n## **The Eclipse Forms**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]] unleashed **[[Solar Dominion]]**, summoning a storm of divine fire. The battlefield erupted in molten fury the sky splitting as burning lances rained down like falling stars. Each step she took drove the sun closer, her presence warping time itself, threatening to lock the world in a moment of endless, unbearable day.\r\n\r\nBut [[Nerrath]] countered with [[Frozen Moonlight]] She froze the falling meteors in the air, shattering them into shimmering dust. With a whisper, she called upon the **[[Veil of Night]]**, swallowing the battlefield in an unnatural darkness that ate away at [[Ashqua]]’s light, a void that even the sun could not pierce.\r\n\r\nYet **[[Ashqua]] did not falter.**\r\n\r\nShe raised the **[[Blade of the Solar Flare]]** and struck—not at [[Nerrath]], but at **reality itself.** The sheer force of the blow **tore open the sky**, fire spilling into the void, turning night into a blinding inferno. **The [[Veil of Night]] burned away**, the moon itself **wounded** by the force of the strike.\r\n\r\nThe land itself became a battlefield of extremes—**one half molten, the other frozen in eternal ice.**\r\n\r\n\r\n## **The Truth Revealed**\r\n\r\nAs they fought, **[[Nerrath]] saw glimpses of her sister’s vision**—of a world that had already ended, of a fate left unfinished. She saw the Unwritten, whispering in the spaces between stories, lurking in the cracks of reality.\r\n\r\nFor the first time, she hesitated.\r\n\r\n**What if [[Ashqua]] was right?**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]] seized the moment. With the last of her strength, she called upon **[[Eternal Day]]**, pouring every last ember of her divinity into a final, devastating act. The **sun itself flared**, its light becoming an all-consuming fire that would **wipe [[The Shattered Isles]] from existence.**\r\n\r\nBut [[Nerrath]] could not let go.\r\n\r\nShe **drew upon the last of her [[Lunar Dominion]], not to strike, but to sever.**\r\n\r\nShe slipped between the threads of fate, stepping beyond time, beyond the battlefield, into the space **between moments.** And there, in that frozen instant, she reached out **and severed [[Ashqua]]’s connection to the Crown.**\r\n\r\nThe effect was **instantaneous.**\r\n\r\nThe fire dimmed. The sun wavered. **For the first time since the war began, the world saw the return of night.**\r\n\r\n[[Ashqua]] staggered, eyes wide in disbelief. The [[Crown of Dayn Break]], still upon her brow, **dimmed and cracked**, its once-uncontested power slipping from her grasp.\r\n\r\n[[Nerrath]] **had won.**\r\n\r\nBut the cost would be great.\r\n\r\n\r\n## **The Price of Victory**\r\n\r\nWith the last of her strength, **[[Nerrath]] reached into the unraveling power of the Crown**, repurposing its energy. No longer would it be a weapon of fire—**it would become a seal.**\r\n\r\nShe **cast [[Ashqua]] into the heart of the sun**, binding her within a prison of her own making. The sun flared one last time, then **dimmed, its overwhelming radiance fading to a warm glow.**\r\n\r\nThe war was over.\r\n\r\nBut **the backlash from the spell was catastrophic.**\r\n\r\n[[Nerrath]]’s physical form **was obliterated**, her divine essence **torn apart and scattered across the [[Bad Lands]].** She had saved the world, but she **could no longer walk upon it.**\r\nAnd so, the world moved forward. The Lunar Court rose to safeguard her memory. [[The Shattered Isles]] began to heal.\r\n\r\nBut deep within the sun, **[[Ashqua]] still burns.**\r\n\r\nShe waits.\r\n\r\nNot for vengeance. Not for conquest.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment when **the world realizes she was right all along.**\r\n\r\nFor the day when [[The Shattered Isles]] **must finally meet their end.**\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Ayzat]]\r\n- [[Iheen's Grand Library]]\r\n- [[Iheen]]\r\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]\r\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]"],[67,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[The Lunar Pact]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/03/30 09:08:21\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: Here, relevant, keywords/phrases, tags:, 1., Eclipse, Wars, 2., Ashqua, 3., Dyson, Sphere, 4., Luna, Pact, 5., Nerrath, 6., Ancient, Dragons, 7., Primal, Powers\r\n\r\nAfter the devastating [[The Eclipse Wars]], [[Ashqua]] was sealed away in the center of the Dyson Sphere.

The  Queen of the Day, a benevolent ruler, commanded the sun’s warmth and light, while the Queen of Night guided the moon, bringing cool serenity and rest. Their shared rule maintained harmony, ensuring balance between day and night.\r\n\r\nYet, hidden within their kingdoms, ancient cults whispered of forbidden powers—primordial beings long sealed away, the true sources of the royal sisters' strength.\r\n\r\nThrough deception and manipulation, the High Priestess of this cult rose to become the Day Queen’s most trusted advisor. She stoked the queen’s fears, urging her to see the Night Princess not as a sister but as a threat. Slowly, the queen hardened, turning from a kind ruler into a tyrant. Eventually, she refused to let the sun set, casting the world into an unending day. Thus began the war—[[The Eclipse Wars]].\r\n\r\nSeeing what she had become, the Night Princess pleaded with her to end the conflict. But she only laughed, dismissing her as a fool. _\"The world belongs to me. Without my light, they would all perish. I do not need your dreams any longer.\"_ And with that, the High Priestess shattered an ancient stone tablet breaking the seal on the primal powers of [[Light]], unleashing a being of pure fire—the true source of the Sun’s power.\r\n\r\nThe entity consumed the Solar Empress, reshaping her into a monstrous form: a goddess of flame, with molten skin and hair like living fire. The sun flared higher, scorching the land as her fallen warriors rose anew—no longer human, but [[Molten]] husks bound to her will.\r\n\r\nThe Lunar armies, despite their resolve, were overwhelmed. The Night Princess, gravely wounded, collapsed, prepared to accept her end. But as she lay dying, another voice called out—deep, cold, and ancient. The seal that had long bound the primordial Night had also been broken.\r\n\r\nDesperate, the Night Princess surrendered herself to the darkness. Shadows and ice enveloped her form, forging her body anew—black as the void, armored in jagged frost. The moon swelled, its light dimming the sun’s blaze, and a thick, cold mist blanketed the battlefield.\r\n\r\nFrom this fog, the first [[Shade]] emerged—the spirits of fallen Lunar warriors, their bodies frozen over, their forms half-shadow and half-ice. Reinvigorated, they rose to fight once more.\r\n\r\nFor centuries, the battle raged. The land itself shattered beneath the warring gods, breaking into scattered isles adrift in the void. The war is forgotten by most, but its scars remain. This is the true origin of light and darkness, the eternal struggle between sun and moon.\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Nerrath]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Ashqua]]\r\n- [[Ayzat]]\r\n- [[Lunar Dominion]]\r\n- [[Molten]]\r\n- [[The Eclipse Wars]]\r\n- [[Work On this Later]]\r\n- [[The Shattered Isles]]"],[64,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Theer]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:32:01\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\ntags: #ShadarKai, #RogueWizard, #Investigator, #ChaoticNeutral, #MoonlightMonarchy, #Espandor, #SilberkammIsles\r\n\r\n# Player Name: Mark\r\n\r\n**Aliases:**  \r\n**Race:**  Elf(Shadar-Kai)\r\n**Class/Occupation:**  Rogue Wizard\r\n**Age:**  133\r\n**Gender:**  Male\r\n**Alignment:**  [[Chaotic Neutral]]\r\n**Background:**  Investigator\r\n**Affiliations:**  \r\n[[Aurene Candra]], [[Din Strider]], [[Dren]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Mumblebeard]], [[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] \r\n## 📝 Description  \r\n![[Pasted image 20250210003608.png]]\r\n\r\n## 🎭 Personality  \r\nJokester adhd demon chilld\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🏹 Abilities & Skills  \r\n\r\n\r\n## ⚔️ Equipment  \r\n\r\n\r\n## 📖 History  \r\nTrained in magic by a will o wisp\r\n\r\n## 🧩 Relationships  \r\n- **Allies:** (Friends, family, mentors)  [[Charlie]]\r\n- **Rivals/Enemies:** (Who opposes them and why?)  \r\n\r\n## 🏔️ Locations Associated  \r\n- **Hometown:**  [[Moonlight Monarchy]], [[Silberkamm Isles]], [[Espandor]]\r\n- **Frequented Places:**  \r\n\r\n## 🎭 Notable Quotes  \r\n> \"A quote that represents the character.\"\r\n\r\n## 🏆 Goals & Motivations  \r\n- **Short-Term Goals:**  \r\n- **Long-Term Goals:**  \r\n\r\n## 🗂️ Notes & Trivia  \r\n- Fun facts, inspirations, or additional details.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n**Tags:** `#character #DND` (or adjust for your system)  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Notes\r\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]\r\n- [[Orin Talonsbane]]\r\n- [[Narazir]]\r\n- [[Flux]]\r\n\r\n## Backlinks\r\n- [[Aurene Candra]]\r\n- [[Din Strider]]\r\n- [[Dren]]\r\n- [[Felladrian]]\r\n- [[Flux]]\r\n- [[Igni]]\r\n- [[Mumblebeard]]\r\n- [[Narazir]]\r\n- [[Okami]]\r\n- [[Orin Talonsbane]]\r\n- [[Player Characters Season 2]]\r\n- [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]]"],[18,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Thraben]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 13:30:47\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\nCapitol City of the [[Moonlight Monarchy]]"],[54,"\n\nNOTE TITLE: [[Thrasios]]\n\nMETADATA:{\"created\":\"2025/03/30 00:59:22\",\"modified\":\"2025/05/08 16:24:31\"}\n\nNOTE BLOCK CONTENT:\n\n![[Thrasios.png]]\nA large agricultural center in the fertile valleys of Críoch Skolvar.
