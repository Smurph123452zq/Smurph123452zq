Session 4: Heart of the Garden

Current Situation
The party has defeated the spiderdragon before it could reach the deepest part of the Garden of Bones shrine. The lair still pulses with molten energy and unsettling whispers. Skeletal Khenra stand silently amid the bone-plants, stirred by the corruption. The heroes now face the shrine’s heart and the mystery behind these restless dead.

Evidence suggests the Heartstone channels molten corruption to the dragon farms, creating ripple effects across [[Magda]]:
* Minor mutations in farm animals.
* Environmental blight warping crops and plant life.
* Disturbing nightmares and growing paranoia among townsfolk.
* Brief temporal distortions near the farms.
Session Goal
* Explore the remaining passages of the shrine and reach the heart chamber.
* Confront any lingering guardians or traps protecting the molten altar.
* Decide what to do with the desecrated Heartstone and any clues surrounding it.

Scene Breakdown
1. Aftermath & Preparation (10–15 min)
   * Allow players a brief rest to gather remains from the spiderdragon and patch wounds.
   * Clues on the corpse or in nearby webs hint at a deeper chamber (molten ichor flowing toward a crack, faint chanting echoes).
   * Optional skill checks: Survival or Investigation DC 12 to spot a hidden passage leading down.
   * Silent Khenra skeletons watch from the garden. A polite greeting or offering grants a chance to learn about their devotion to [[Nerrath]]. Hostility leads to a brief skirmish using the Restless Khenra stat block.

2. Descent Toward the Heart (30–40 min)
   * Hazard – Crumbling Tunnels: The path is unstable, dotted with fissures leaking molten fluid. Dex (Acrobatics) or Str (Athletics) DC 13 to navigate without sliding into small pits (1d6 fire damage on failure).
   * Strange Whispers: Wis (Perception) DC 13 to notice an undercurrent of voices urging them to turn back or to "feed" the heart. Failing by 5 or more imposes disadvantage on the next check due to unsettling visions.
   * Molten Spiders: 1–2 corrupted giant spiders cling to the ceiling. Use Giant Spider stats with an extra 1d4 fire damage on bite/web.

3. Heart Chamber (40–50 min)
   * Description: A vast cavity dominated by a pulsating mass of obsidian and crystalline bone—the Molten Heartstone—set atop a twisted altar of fused bones. Streams of molten energy flow into it from cracks in the walls.
   * Environmental Effects: Areas of bubbling magma (2d6 fire), thick smoke causing Con saves DC 13 or become poisoned for 1 minute.
   * Guardian: A "Molten Effigy" rises from the altar (use Mephit or Magma Mephit stats, upgraded with extra hit points and a short-range magma burst).
   * Skill Challenge/Combat: Defeating or bypassing the guardian while avoiding hazards. Players can attempt creative solutions—disrupt energy flows, topple bone pillars, or use the spiderdragon remains as leverage.

4. Discovery & Choice (15–20 min)
   * Investigating the altar reveals fragments of an obsidian tablet etched with runes referencing Ashqua and a ritual to "nurture the garden." Arcana or Religion DC 14 to glean that the Heartstone is a conduit spreading corruption to the farms.
   * Possible options:
     * Destroy the Heartstone: Requires concentrated effort (skill checks or direct attacks) and could trigger a violent eruption—Dex saves to avoid backlash.
     * Remove/Seal It: Experiment with magic or tools to extract the Heartstone, potentially using runes discovered in earlier sessions. This may stabilize the area but draws attention from unknown forces.
     * Leave It Alone: Could be used later or studied by Magda's Lorekeepers.
    * Provide flavorful loot: shards of obsidian worth modest coin, the obsidian tablet, and salvageable molten glands from the effigy.

Object Lore & Player Leads
* **Heartstone Shards:** Fragments of the altar hold lingering molten energy. They could be forged into potent weapons or studied for clues about [[Ashqua]].
* **Obsidian Tablet:** Broken lines reference "nurturing the garden." Matching pieces may surface in [[Iheen's Grand Library]].
* **Molten Glands:** Harvested from the effigy or warped beasts. Alchemists in [[Magda]] or the [[Stonecarvers’ Guild]] might pay dearly.
* **Spiderdragon Remains:** Venom sacs and fangs fetch a good price or form the basis for unique poisons.
* **Fused Bone Relics:** Bones fused with obsidian hint at draconic shrines predating the town; investigating them could reveal hidden history.

Closing Questions for Players
* How does confronting the Heartstone affect your character's view of the corruption in Magda?
* What do you plan to do with the artifacts and knowledge gained here?
* Who in Magda (or beyond) might you trust—or fear—when revealing what you've discovered?
