## Whispers in the Caves - Opening Beats
**Session Summary:** This session introduces the players to [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) and its growing problem with agitated dragons and strange occurrences near the dragon farms. The party will be tasked by [Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar) to investigate initial reports, leading them into the caves where they’ll encounter their first challenges – both combat and clues – hinting at a larger threat.

**Scene Breakdown:**

1. **Arrival in Magda (30-45 mins):** Players arrive in [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md), either as locals or travelers. Focus on establishing the atmosphere described in the note: labyrinthine city, stone & metal scent, dragon farms nearby. Introduce key locations like the [Glimmering Grotto](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FGlimmering%20Grotto.md) and potentially [The Root & Vine](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FThe%20Root%20%26%20Vine.md).
2. **Brynjar’s Request (30 mins):** Players are summoned to meet with [[Elder Brynjar]], who explains the growing unrest among the dragons and requests their assistance in investigating the caves near the dragon farms. This is where the initial quest is given: investigate reports of agitated dragons.
3. **Dragon Farm Investigation (45-60 mins):** The party visits a nearby dragon farm, interacting with concerned farmers and witnessing firsthand the agitated state of the dragons. They gather clues about strange behavior and potentially encounter a minor incident – a frightened [[Root Drake]] nearly breaking free.
4. **Cave Entrance & Initial Exploration (60-90 mins):** Players enter the caves near the farms. This scene focuses on exploration, description, and a first combat encounter. The goal is to introduce the unsettling atmosphere of the caves and hint at something amiss.

**Encounters:**

- **Agitated Dragon (Non-Lethal Focus):** A young, frightened dragon (use stats for a very young/small dragon – perhaps reskinning a wolf or large dog stat block) that is agitated but not actively malicious. The encounter should focus on calming the dragon rather than fighting it. Success could involve skill checks (Animal Handling, Persuasion) and offering soothing herbs from [Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock).
- **[[Mutated Wildlife]] (Combat):** 2-3 mutated creatures affected by Ashqua’s energy (reskin rats or bats with slightly increased stats and a creepy appearance). This is the first combat encounter – keep it simple and manageable for level 1 characters. Focus on establishing that something _is_ wrong, not necessarily a full-blown threat.
- **Hidden Shrine (Investigation):** A small shrine dedicated to nature spirits, defiled or corrupted with strange symbols. Requires investigation skill checks to uncover clues about the corruption.

**Roleplay & NPCs:**

- **[Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar):** Portray her as wise and concerned, but also hesitant to jump to conclusions. She should emphasize the importance of understanding the situation before resorting to violence. Focus on her connection to nature and dragons.
- **Farmers:** Play them as stressed and worried about their livelihood. They can provide rumors about the “red glow” in the caves and whispers of old legends.
- **[Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock):** A source of local lore and herbal remedies. He can offer clues about the defiled shrine and suggest calming herbs for the dragons.

**Hooks & Momentum:**

End the session with a cliffhanger: While exploring deeper into the caves, the party discovers evidence of a hidden chamber or tunnel leading further down. They also find a strange energy fluctuation detected by their equipment (or a character’s intuition). This sets up Session 2's exploration of “Deeper Descent.”

**Prep Work:**

- **Maps:** Sketch out a simple map of [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) and the surrounding dragon farms, as well as a basic cave layout for the initial exploration area.
- **Creature Stat Blocks:** Prepare stat blocks for the agitated dragon (reskinned), mutated wildlife, and any other creatures you anticipate encountering.
- **NPC Profiles:** Flesh out brief profiles for [Elder Brynjar](app://obsidian.md/Elder%20Brynjar), farmers, and [Old Man Hemlock](app://obsidian.md/Old%20Man%20Hemlock). Include key personality traits and dialogue prompts.
- **Handouts:** Consider a simple handout with rumors circulating in [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md) or a map of the dragon farms.
- **Skill Check Lists:** Have a list of relevant skill checks prepared for each scene (e.g., Animal Handling, Persuasion, Investigation).
