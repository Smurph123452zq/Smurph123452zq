# Session 4: Heart of the Garden

## Current Situation
The party has just routed the spiderdragon before it could reach the innermost shrine. Molten energy still bleeds from the walls and the heroes now stand at the threshold of the shrine's corrupted heart. Rumors point to the Heartstone here fueling troubles across [[Magda]].

## Session Goals
- Navigate the remaining passages leading to the heart chamber.
- Overcome lingering guardians or traps protecting the molten altar.
- Decide how to handle the desecrated Heartstone and gather clues for future adventures.

## Phase 1: Aftermath & Preparation
- Offer a short rest so characters can collect remains from the spiderdragon and mend wounds.
- Searching the lair reveals clues: molten ichor flowing toward a narrow crack and faint chanting echoing below.
- **Skill checks:** DC 12 Survival or Investigation to discover a hidden passage leading deeper.

## Phase 2: Descent Toward the Heart
- **Crumbling Tunnels:** The path is unstable with fissures leaking molten fluid. DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) or Strength (Athletics) check to avoid slipping into pits (1d6 fire damage on a failure).
- **Strange Whispers:** DC 13 Wisdom (Perception) to hear voices urging them to feed the heart. Failing by 5 or more imposes disadvantage on the next check due to unsettling visions.
- **[[Molten Giant Spider|Molten Spiders]]:** 1–2 corrupted giant spiders cling to the ceiling (use Giant Spider stats with an extra 1d4 fire damage on bite or web).

## Phase 3: The Heart Chamber
- **Description:** A vast cavity houses a pulsating mass of obsidian and crystalline bone—the Molten Heartstone—set atop a twisted altar of fused bones. Streams of molten energy seep through cracks.
- **Environmental Effects:** Bubbling magma pockets (2d6 fire damage) and thick smoke requiring a DC 13 Constitution save or become poisoned for 1 minute.
- **Guardian:** A "[[Molten Effigy]]" forms from the altar (reskin a Mephit with extra hit points and a short-range magma burst).
- **Challenge:** Defeating or bypassing the effigy while avoiding hazards. Encourage creative tactics—redirect energy flows, topple bone pillars, or leverage spiderdragon remains.

## Phase 4: Discovery & Choice
- **The Altar:** Fragments of an obsidian tablet reference [[Ashqua]] and a ritual to "nurture the garden." Arcana or Religion DC 14 reveals that the Heartstone channels corruption to the farms.
- **Player Options:**
  - *Destroy the Heartstone:* Requires focused effort (skill checks or direct attacks) and risks a violent eruption—Dexterity saves to avoid the backlash.
  - *Remove or Seal It:* Experiment with magic or tools to extract the stone, perhaps using runes learned earlier. This may stabilize the area but draws unknown attention.
  - *Leave It Be:* Preserve it for study by [[Lorekeepers]] or the [[Stonecarvers’ Guild]].
- **Loot Ideas:** Obsidian shards worth moderate coin, the broken tablet, and salvageable molten glands from the effigy.

## Object Lore & Leads
- **Heartstone Shards:** Fragments brimming with lingering fire energy.
    - Forge a blade or tool with a DC 14 Smith's Tools check to add **+1 fire damage** on hits.
    - Study them to trace [[Ashqua]]'s influence or power fire‑based rituals.
- **Obsidian Tablet:** Broken pieces etched with the "garden" ritual.
    - Combining fragments might reveal how to cleanse—or amplify—the Heartstone.
    - Scholars at [[Iheen's Grand Library]] trade coin or lore favors for each shard.
- **Molten Glands:** Harvested from fiery beasts and the [[Molten Effigy]].
    - Distill into volatile firebombs or protective salves that resist heat.
    - Ritualists in [[Magda]] or the [[Stonecarvers’ Guild]] will pay handsomely for them.
- **Spiderdragon Remains:** Venom sacs and fangs perfect for alchemy.
    - Craft poisons (DC 13) that deal 1d4 extra poison damage when applied to weapons.
    - The fangs double as macabre trophies or intimidating ritual tools.
- **Fused Bone Relics:** Twisted bones hinting at ancient draconic shrines.
    - Research may unlock forgotten histories or secret locations.
    - Wearing a bone charm grants advantage on saves against fear for one day.

## Closing Questions for Players
- How does confronting the Heartstone change your view of the corruption in [[Magda]]?
- What will you do with the artifacts and knowledge uncovered here?
- Who in Magda—or beyond—might you trust or fear when revealing these discoveries?
