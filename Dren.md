## 📖 History  
Born the youngest of 6 siblings, drenari lunarshard was never in line to become head of the house. The lack of expectations cause a divide between him and his older siblings, but he was close to the fourth sibling in line, his sister Mecelle. Shortly before his 5th birthday, mecelle was sent away on account of an arranged marriage, leaving drenari by himself. He began acting up, pranking and stealing around the family grounds. When it was discovered that he was blessed by the gods, his family was more than happy to send him away. 

  

Publicly known as medical professionals, the lunarshard clan trains all the doctors on their island. Behind closed doors, they have been secretly keeping the lycanthropy bloodlines alive. Dren has yet to undergo the ritual to become a lycanthrope. (Wereowl/wereraven?).
