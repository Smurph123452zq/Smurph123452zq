## Date

Approximately a decade after [[Moonfall]]

## Summary

As [[Ashqua]]'s prison waned, the [[New Solar Republic]] declared war on the [[Moonlight Monarchy]]. For ten years her whispers twisted citizens into [[Molten]] thralls. Fighting raged across [[Châteaufeu]] and the surrounding isles until heroes disrupted Ashqua's hold, leading to the Republic's destruction.

## Narrative

Border clashes soon gave way to open war as Ashqua's whispers drove the Republic to fanatic fury. [[Aurene Candra]], [[Dren]], [[Din Strider]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Mumblebeard]], [[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Theer]], and [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] answered the Monarchy's call. During the final siege, [[Mumblebeard]] wielded the [[Nerrath#The Heart of Nerrath|Heart of Nerrath]], shielding the group from Ashqua's molten fury.
