## Personality

Once kind and fair, [[Ashqua]] was manipulated into paranoia and tyranny. Her fear of losing control led her to reject balance, ultimately transforming her into a cruel ruler. She views the world as hers to command, believing that without her light, all life would perish.

## Abilities and Skills

- **[[Solar Dominion]]:** Controls the sun’s fire and light, capable of raising temperatures to unbearable levels.
- **[[Molten Rebirth]]:** Fallen warriors under her command are resurrected as molten husks, bound to her will.
- **[[Eternal Day]]:** Has the power to prevent the sun from setting, casting the world into an unending day.
- **[[Divine Presence]]:** Her mere presence scorches the land, making prolonged encounters with her dangerous.

## Equipment

- **[[Crown of Day Break]]**: An artifact that amplifies her dominion over fire and light.
- **[[Blade of the Solar Flare]]:** A weapon wreathed in eternal flames, capable of cutting through the strongest of defenses.


## Classes

- **Bladesinging Wizard**: Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways. In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.
- **Oathbreaker**: An Oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks his or her sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart has been extinguished. Only darkness remains.
## History

Born a mortal, Ashqua ascended to godhood alongside her sister, [[Nerrath]], with the aid of the enigmatic [[Unwritten]]. As ruler of the Day Kingdom, she ensured prosperity and warmth, but was ultimately deceived by a High Priestess who sought to unlock forbidden primordial power.

Blinded by ambition and fear, Ashqua was consumed by an entity of pure fire, transforming into the tyrannical goddess she is today. She waged war against her sister, refusing to let the sun set, plunging the world into **[[The Eclipse Wars]]**. In the ensuing war, the land was shattered, giving rise to the scattered isles that exist today.

After the devastating War of [[The Eclipse Wars]], Ashqua was sealed away in the center of the Dyson Sphere. This was achieved through the United Mortal Pact, an agreement between [[Nerrath]], the ancient dragons, and the mortals.

## Relationships

- **[[Nerrath]] (Sister, Goddess of the Moon):** Once her closest companion, now her eternal rival.
- **The High Priestess [[Ayzat]]:** A manipulative figure who led Ashqua down her dark path.
- **The [[Unwritten]]:** Mysterious off world beings who aided in her apotheosis but have since become her enemy.
## Trivia

- Ashqua was once known for her golden laughter, which could brighten the darkest days. Now, her voice is like crackling flame.
- Her followers believe that one day, she will burn away all impurity, leaving only her light behind.



### Intentions

When **Ashqua ascended to godhood**, she glimpsed the greater fabric of reality, the unseen forces shaping existence. She saw that the **Shattered Isles were never meant to persist.** Their story was supposed to end, their fate written in the stars. Yet something **unnatural** kept them lingering—**The Unwritten.**

These formless, discarded ideas, half-told stories, and broken fates had taken root, corrupting reality itself. The world **refused to die**, its final chapter left unfinished. And in doing so, it had become a **cancer upon the multiverse.**

Only **she** could fix it. Only **fire** could cleanse it.

Ashqua did not seek conquest—she sought **destruction.** Not out of malice, but **mercy.** The Shattered Isles had to burn, their story wiped clean so that the Unwritten’s influence would not spread. If she did nothing, the **infection would fester**, consuming the rest of existence in **false stories, unfulfilled endings, and endless stagnation.**

But **Nerrath did not understand.**

Her sister, bound by mortal love and duty, still clung to the world—to its people, its history, its future. **She could not accept that the Shattered Isles were a mistake.** She could not bear the weight of the knowledge Ashqua had seen.

And so, she stood in the way.
