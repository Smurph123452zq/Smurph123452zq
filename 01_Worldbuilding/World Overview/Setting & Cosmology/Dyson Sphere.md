# Dyson Sphere

The Shattered Isles exist within a vast **Dyson Sphere**â€”an artificial structure built to capture nearly all the energy of the local sun. Legends say this megastructure once supported mighty civilizations, with continents and mechanisms carefully arranged to regulate day and night.

## Purpose
A Dyson Sphere surrounds a star with a shell or swarm of satellites, providing limitless power for any society advanced enough to construct it. In many worlds this idea is purely theoretical, but here it is the foundation of reality itself.

## After the Shattering
When the catastrophe known as [[The Tale of the Shattering]] tore the interior apart, the land shattered into drifting islands and asteroids. These fragments now orbit the imprisoned sun within the sphere, forming what is now called [[The Shattered Isles]].

## Legacy
During the [[Eclipse Wars]], [[Nerrath]] sealed [[Ashqua]] within the heart of the Dyson Sphere. Though damaged, the sphere still sustains life and maintains its artificial cycle of day and night.
