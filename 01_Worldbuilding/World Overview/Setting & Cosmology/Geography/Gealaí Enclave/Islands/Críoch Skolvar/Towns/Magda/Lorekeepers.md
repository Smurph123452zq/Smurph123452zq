**Role & Responsibilities:** The [[Lorekeepers]] are druids and scholars dedicated to studying the natural energies of [[Magda]] and its surrounding environment. They form one of the major social classes within the city, emphasizing communal living and shared responsibility. 

**Notable Members:** [[Elder Brynjar]], a wise Dragonborn Lorekeeper, is currently the spiritual leader/council head of [[Magda]].

**Skills & Training:** The [[Lorekeepers]] likely possess expertise in druidic practices, herbalism, natural philosophy, ancient lore (particularly relating to dragons and nature spirits), and potentially geomancy or energy manipulation. 

**Relationship to other factions:** They collaborate with the [[Dragon Harmony Collective]] to understand and coexist with dragons. They also work closely with the [[Stone Wardens]] who maintain the cave systems, as the caves are central to their studies of natural energies.

**Possible Tasks/Duties:**
*   Communing with nature spirits within hidden grottoes.
*   Studying mineral veins and their energetic properties.
*   Preserving ancient dragon lore and traditions.
*   Providing guidance on sustainable practices.
*   Offering healing remedies derived from cave flora.

**Key Locations:** 
* Hidden grottoes where druids commune with the earth’s energies.
* The “[[Vein of Azurite]],” a mineral deposit believed to hold ancient energy, is likely a site of study for them.

**Rumors & Mysteries:** Given concerns about the long-term effects of [[Moonfall]] on the local ecosystem and reports of unusual creatures emerging from deeper tunnels, it’s possible the [[Lorekeepers]] are investigating these phenomena and seeking ways to restore balance. They may also be researching the strange energy fluctuations within the caves.
