**Description:** A cozy, dimly lit inn nestled within the cave systems of [[Magda]], renowned for its calming atmosphere and extensive selection of herbal teas brewed from locally-sourced cave flora. The air is thick with the scent of dried herbs, damp stone, and a hint of woodsmoke.  Rough-hewn wooden tables are surrounded by cushioned seats woven from dragonvine fibers, offering comfortable respite to travelers and locals alike.

**Location:** Situated near the [[Glimmering Grotto]], but tucked away on a quieter side passage, allowing for a more secluded experience. 

**Proprietor:** [[Old Man Hemlock]], a human of indeterminate age with a long, grey beard and kind eyes. He’s known throughout [[Magda]] as a repository of local lore and a skilled herbalist.  He claims to have arrived in [[Magda]] as a refugee from [[Zonnewij Isels]].

**Ambiance & Features:**

*   **Herbal Teas:** The specialty of the house. Hemlock brews dozens of different teas, each with unique properties – calming blends for weary travelers, invigorating mixes for artisans, and even restorative concoctions rumored to aid in healing.  A full list is posted near the bar (see below).
*   **Quiet Corners:** Several alcoves offer privacy for conversations or quiet contemplation. 
*   **Stone Fireplace:** A perpetually burning fireplace provides warmth and a focal point for the inn.
*   **Dragonvine Decor:** Woven dragonvine accents are prevalent throughout the inn, adding to its unique aesthetic.
*   **No Music:** Hemlock believes music disrupts the calming atmosphere he cultivates.
