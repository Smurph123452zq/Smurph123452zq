![[Magda.png]]
Magda is a small, labyrinthine settlement carved into a network of caves and underground tunnels. With fewer than a hundred inhabitants, it is renowned for skilled artisans who craft intricate jewelry and weapons from locally sourced minerals. Dimly lit and claustrophobic, Magda offers a unique atmosphere filled with communal workshops, hidden passages, and the scent of stone and metal. Adjacent to the town are specialized farms cultivating crops to nourish docile dragons – their fields often protected by small shrines honoring nature spirits. The architecture subtly incorporates elements reflecting the ancient dragon nesting sites found within the caves.
