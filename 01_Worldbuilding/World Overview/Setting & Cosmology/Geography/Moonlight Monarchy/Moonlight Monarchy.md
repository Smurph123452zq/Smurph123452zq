Once a scattered collection of feuding baronies, the Moonlight Monarchy now
answers to a single High Queen seated in [[Thraben]]. Each island retains its
own duke or duchess, but all swear fealty to the Lunar Court and uphold the
traditions of [[Nerrath]]. Knights who ride the descendants of ancient dragons
patrol the skies, guarding trade routes and the borders of the Bad Lands.

Victory in the recent [[The Molten War]] left the Monarchy wary yet resolute.
They maintain close ties with the [[Gealaí Enclave]] and the [[United Mortal
Pact]], but distrust lingers toward any remnants of the [[New Solar Republic]].
The common folk value honor and communal defense, mustering militias whenever
Ashqua's corrupted beasts threaten their shores.
