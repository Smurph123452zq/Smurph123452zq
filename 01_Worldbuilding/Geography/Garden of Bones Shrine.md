# Garden of Bones Shrine

An ancient cavern hidden beneath [[Magda]], once a sacred cradle where Nerrath's shades were born. Bone-like growths and lunar symbols mark the age of her worship here.

## Origins
- **Nerrath's Domain:** The shrine originally nurtured spirits loyal to the Veiled Moon. Gentle shadows wove through crystalline tunnels, and newborn shades emerged to guide the living.
- **Ashqua's Intrusion:** In recent years, molten corruption seeped into the caverns. The heartstone now pulses with stolen heat, twisting the shrine's purpose and drawing the attention of [[Ashqua]].

## Current State
- Faint moonlight lingers in corners untouched by molten growth, offering solace to those who oppose corruption.
- The bone growths echo with whispers â€” some benevolent, others tainted by fiery influence.
- **Forgotten Site:** Generations of cave-ins and secrecy erased the shrine from [[Magda]]'s collective memory. Few surface dwellers suspect it exists at all.
