After the devastating [[The Eclipse Wars]], [[Ashqua]] was sealed away in the center of the Dyson Sphere. This was achieved through the Luna Pact, an agreement between [[Nerrath]], the ancient dragons, and the mortals.

- **[[The Dragons' Sacrifice]]:** The ancient dragons gave up their intellect, becoming like beasts.
- **[[Nerrath's Sacrifice]]:** Nerrath relinquished her avatar, scattering her essence across the Badlands.
- **[[The Mortals' Pact]]:** The mortals bound themselves to the primal powers, allowing them to wield these forces should they need to defend the world again.
