In the beginning, the world was ruled by two Kingdoms, each governing one half of existence. The  Queen of the Day, a benevolent ruler, commanded the sun’s warmth and light, while the Queen of Night guided the moon, bringing cool serenity and rest. Their shared rule maintained harmony, ensuring balance between day and night.

Yet, hidden within their kingdoms, ancient cults whispered of forbidden powers—primordial beings long sealed away, the true sources of the royal sisters' strength.

Through deception and manipulation, the High Priestess of this cult rose to become the Day Queen’s most trusted advisor. She stoked the queen’s fears, urging her to see the Night Princess not as a sister but as a threat. Slowly, the queen hardened, turning from a kind ruler into a tyrant. Eventually, she refused to let the sun set, casting the world into an unending day. Thus began the war—[[The Eclipse Wars]].

Seeing what she had become, the Night Princess pleaded with her to end the conflict. But she only laughed, dismissing her as a fool. _"The world belongs to me. Without my light, they would all perish. I do not need your dreams any longer."_ And with that, the High Priestess shattered an ancient stone tablet breaking the seal on the primal powers of [[Light]], unleashing a being of pure fire—the true source of the Sun’s power.

The entity consumed the Solar Empress, reshaping her into a monstrous form: a goddess of flame, with molten skin and hair like living fire. The sun flared higher, scorching the land as her fallen warriors rose anew—no longer human, but [[Molten]] husks bound to her will.

The Lunar armies, despite their resolve, were overwhelmed. The Night Princess, gravely wounded, collapsed, prepared to accept her end. But as she lay dying, another voice called out—deep, cold, and ancient. The seal that had long bound the primordial Night had also been broken.

Desperate, the Night Princess surrendered herself to the darkness. Shadows and ice enveloped her form, forging her body anew—black as the void, armored in jagged frost. The moon swelled, its light dimming the sun’s blaze, and a thick, cold mist blanketed the battlefield.

From this fog, the first [[Shade]] emerged—the spirits of fallen Lunar warriors, their bodies frozen over, their forms half-shadow and half-ice. Reinvigorated, they rose to fight once more.

For centuries, the battle raged. The land itself shattered beneath the warring gods, breaking into scattered isles adrift in the void. The war is forgotten by most, but its scars remain. This is the true origin of light and darkness, the eternal struggle between sun and moon.

### Legacy of the Shattering
The broken world eventually settled into drifting archipelagos now known as [[The Shattered Isles]]. Survivors rallied around new banners: those loyal to [[Nerrath]] founded the [[Moonlight Monarchy]], hoping to restore balance, while zealots of [[Ashqua]] formed the [[New Solar Republic]] to reclaim her lost glory. Their opposing ideologies laid the groundwork for future strife—including events like [[Moonfall]] and [[The Molten War]].
