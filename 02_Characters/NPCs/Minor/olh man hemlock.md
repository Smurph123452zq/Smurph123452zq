“Troubled sleep, I presume?” Hemlock asked, his tone gentle. Elara nodded, running a hand through her tangled hair. “The whispers…they’re getting louder. About things in the caves.”

Hemlock chuckled, a dry rasping sound. "Ah, yes. Old Man Tiber has been at it again." He gestured with a gnarled finger towards a hunched figure huddled near the hearth, stirring a murky liquid in a chipped mug. “Tiber Stonefist. Claims to have seen… _changes_ in the wildlife beyond the dragon farms. Mutated creatures, he says. Twisted by something dark.”

Elara frowned. "I've heard him before. He’s always been prone to exaggeration."

“Perhaps,” Hemlock conceded, placing her tea before her. “But Tiber isn’t malicious. Just… lonely. Lost his son years ago in a cave-in while mining azurite. Now he spends his days wandering the outskirts, claiming to see signs and omens. He says the creatures are growing bolder, more _wrong_. That their eyes glow with an unnatural light.”

Hemlock leaned closer, lowering his voice. “He claims they’re not just animals anymore. That something is… influencing them. Something old and hungry." He paused, studying Elara's face. "He says the corruption started after the debris from Moonfall settled, seeping into the earth like a poison.”

Elara took a sip of her tea, its calming effects doing little to soothe her unease. “And you believe him?”

Hemlock shrugged. “I’ve lived long enough to know that even the wildest tales often have a grain of truth. Tiber isn't seeking attention; he seems genuinely frightened. He says he saw one – a rat, but… _different_. Pale and twitching, with holes burned through its fur as if touched by sunlight in the dark.”

He glanced towards Tiber, who was now staring intently into his mug, muttering under his breath about “shadows” and “awakening”. Hemlock sighed. "Pay him no mind unless you start seeing things yourself. But… keep your eyes open, Elara. The caves have always held secrets. And some secrets are best left undisturbed."

The story establishes Tiber as a lonely, grieving man whose motivations stem from personal loss rather than malice. It casts doubt on his claims while simultaneously hinting at the possibility of something truly unsettling happening in the caves. His description of the mutated rat aligns with the notes about the corrupted wildlife and introduces the idea that Moonfall might be connected to the disturbances. The ending leaves Elara (and potentially the players) with a sense of unease and encourages further investigation.
