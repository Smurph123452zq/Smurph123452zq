- Decisions typically come through open discussion, though Ben or Derrik may make quick choices when stealth or diplomacy is required.
- Playstyles range from roleplay-heavy (Lucky, Eldar) to tactical combat (Hallar, Jord), with the group leaning into teamwork and occasional pranks.

## Narrative Threads
- **Active Quest:** Investigate corrupted wildlife and locate the hidden [[Shrine of Ayzat]].
- **Ongoing Mysteries:** Origins of the spark-shifters, the cause of mutated beasts, and Eldar’s cryptic visions from [[Ashqua]].
- **Future Arcs:** Delving deeper into the [[Garden of Bones Shrine]] or uncovering relics tied to the Eclipse Wars.
- **Recurring Themes:** Balance of sun and moon, lingering corruption, and the party’s unlikely unity.

## NPC Network
- **Allies:** [[Stone Speaker Hemlock]] and Elder [[Brynjar]] in Magda; hermit [[Whistletooth]] offers cryptic advice.

- **Wild Cards:** Contacts from Derrik’s criminal past or Ben’s jealous arcane rivals could aid or hinder the party.

## DM Notes
- Consider encounters that highlight each character’s strengths—stealth missions for Derrik and Lucky, spiritual visions for Eldar and Hallar, and fey-related challenges for Rexx.
- Rexx’s eccentric LeShay patron may appear with bizarre mushroom quests or offer sinister bargains, tempting him toward a warlock path.
- Secrets currently unknown to the party: the corrupted wildlife is tied to an ancient relic buried near Ayzat’s shrine, and Ben’s patron seeks it for their own ends.
- Future beats may involve revealing the true name of Skarhn’s rebirth benefactor and testing the group’s loyalty when personal quests clash with their shared mission.
