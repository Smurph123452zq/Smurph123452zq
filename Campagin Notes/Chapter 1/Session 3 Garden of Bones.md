# Quest: The Garden of Bones Shrine

## Current Situation
The party is exploring a branch of caves past the farms. They have encountered mutated wildlife and a CR 6 spiderdragon corrupted by molten energy. The spiderdragon, having been fought, has fled, and the party is believed to be chasing it.

**New Information:** The spiderdragon is nesting in a **hidden shrine** that is the source of the "molten corruption" and the irregularities around the town of Magda. The shrine's atmosphere and visuals will be heavily inspired by the song "Garden of Bones" by Galdorcraeft.

## Session Goal
* The party successfully tracks the injured spiderdragon.
* They engage the spiderdragon in a final confrontation within its lair, the "Garden of Bones" shrine.
* They discover the true nature of the shrine as the source of Magda's irregularities.

## Phase 1: The Chase Through the Corrupted Caves

The spiderdragon is wounded and fleeing, aiming to reach the sanctuary of its lair â€“ the hidden shrine.

### 1. Setting the Scene
* **Recap:** Remind players of the spiderdragon's escape and their pursuit.
* **Sensory Details:** Emphasize the escalating heat, the pervasive smell of ozone and sulfur, and the constant chittering of unseen, molten-corrupted wildlife. The air grows thick and heavy. As they go deeper, the natural caves begin to give way to something unnatural.

### 2. The Chase Mechanics (Skill Challenge)
Present a series of obstacles requiring different skills over 3-5 "rounds" of chase. Successes gain ground; failures lead to minor setbacks or hazards.

* **Round 1: Tracking/Navigation**
    * **Challenge:** The caves branch frequently; the spiderdragon tries to obscure its path.
    * **Skills:** DC 13-15 Wisdom (Survival) to follow tracks, or DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) to spot subtle clues (molten scorch marks, shed chitin).
    * **Outcome:** Success means gaining ground. Failure means losing ground or taking a longer, more dangerous path.

* **Round 2: Environmental Hazard - Molten Pools**
    * **Challenge:** A chamber crisscrossed by glowing, bubbling streams of molten rock.
    * **Skills:** DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) to jump/balance, or DC 13 Strength (Athletics) to navigate.
    * **Outcome:** Failure risks 1d6-2d6 fire damage and/or being slowed.

* **Round 3: Corrupted Wildlife Ambush/Distraction**
    * **Challenge:** The spiderdragon kicks down a cluster of pulsating, molten-corrupted bats (use *Swarm of Bats* stat block, +1 fire damage per hit, glow) or stirs up mutated centipedes.
    * **Skills:** Quick combat encounter (1-2 rounds) against minor threats, or DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) to slip past.
    * **Outcome:** Distraction causes time loss or minor damage.

* **Round 4: Obstacle - Dense, Glowing Webs**
    * **Challenge:** Passages choked with thick, superheated, obsidian-like webbing.
    * **Skills:** DC 14 Strength (Athletics) to tear through, or DC 12 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) to find weak points.
    * **Outcome:** Contact with webs deals 1d4 fire damage. Failure risks entanglement.

## Phase 2: The Spiderdragon's Lair - The Garden of Bones Shrine

The chase culminates in a distinct, unnaturally carved cavern system: the "Garden of Bones" shrine.

### 1. Lair Description
* **Appearance:** This vast, unnaturally carved chamber is lit by the oppressive, intense orange/red glow from numerous fissures and bubbling molten pools. Jagged stalactites drip not water, but slow beads of liquid fire. The air shimmers with heat, thick with the smell of sulfur, ozone, and something metallic, like hot blood and rust.
* **The "Garden":** The most striking feature. The floor and lower walls are choked with a horrific forest of **molten-infused skeletal remains.** These bones are fused into the rock, standing upright like grotesque, glowing plants. Some are humanoid, others monstrous, all dripping with slow beads of molten ichor.
* **Lyrical Integration (Visual/Atmosphere):**
    * "This is the **Garden of Bones**, where shadows dance and memories cease." (Describe distorted light, unsettling aura).
    * "From the **ash and dust**, new horrors bloom in silent, grim embrace." (Emphasize the twisted life and decay).
    * "The ground itself is **cold and stark**, a tapestry of graves." (Despite heat, sense of pervasive death).
* **Aural Cues:** The hiss and pop of cooling lava, distant earth rumbling, and faint, melancholic whispers or discordant moans seemingly emanating from the skeletal growths.
* **Hazards:**
    * **Molten Patches:** Any creature entering a molten patch space takes 2d6 fire damage.
    * **Molten Webs:** Webs are difficult terrain. Anyone moving through or touching them takes 1d4 fire damage. Breaking them requires a DC 12 Strength check or fire damage.

### 2. The Spiderdragon's Role & Tactics
The young spiderdragon is a product and protector of the shrine's corruption, likely more aggressive and heavily mutated.
* **Elevated Threat:** Consider a minor boost (a few more HP, a legendary resistance, or an additional "Molten Burst" area attack) to reflect its connection to the shrine.
* **Tactics:** It will use the bone growths and molten streams for cover and strategic attacks, spitting corrosive venom/molten webbing, and attempting to push characters into hazards. It defends its "garden" fiercely.
* **Optional Minions:** 1-2 "Molten Spiders" (reskin *Giant Spiders*: bite deals 1d4 bonus fire damage, web is sticky + 1d4 fire damage on contact) emerge, drawn by the conflict.

### 3. The Final Confrontation
Make the fight cinematic, leveraging the shrine's environment. Describe its molten-infused attacks and movements.

## Phase 3: Discovery & The Source of Corruption

Upon defeating the spiderdragon, the party can explore the shrine.

### 1. Loot & Rewards
* **Spiderdragon Remains:** Chitin, venom sacs, fiery glands (valuable for crafting fire resistance potions, special weapons).
* **Hoard:** Nestled among the webs, perhaps in a cooler crevice:
    * Modest coins and gems (fire opals, obsidian).
    * A magic item: e.g., a *Cloak of Protection* (singed but functional) or a *Ring of Warmth*.
    * **Crucial Clue:** A **Molten Orb** (fist-sized, pulsating obsidian sphere, unnaturally hot) or a fragmented **Obsidian Tablet** with strange, glowing runes. This is a direct link to the source of corruption.

### 2. The Source of Corruption: The Twisted Heart of the Garden
At the very heart of the shrine, likely where the spiderdragon nested, lies the true source of Magda's irregularities:
* **The Desecrated Altar/Heartstone:** A glowing, pulsating mass of **obsidian and crystalline bone**, embedded in the earth or atop a crude altar, constantly oozing fresh molten corruption. Around it, the bone-plants are densest and most unnaturally vibrant.
* **The Irregularities (Possible Effects in Magda):**
    * **Minor Mutations:** Farm animals developing strange growths or aggressive tendencies.
    * **Environmental Blight:** Patches of plant life dying or becoming twisted and carnivorous.
    * **Psychological Effects:** Strange nightmares, increased paranoia, or unusual fevers among townsfolk.
    * **Temporal Flux:** Minor time distortions, objects appearing or disappearing briefly.

### 3. Post-Combat Discoveries
Interacting with the Molten Heartstone/Altar could trigger:
* A sudden **flash of disturbing images:** A forgotten ritual, ancient figures, a sacrifice, or a dark power being unleashed.
* A **wave of psychic feedback:** Filling their minds with fragmented whispers, perhaps sounding like verses from "Garden of Bones."
* A **horrific realization:** The shrine is actively *absorbing* something (life force, sanity, time) from the area, twisting it into the molten blight.
* **Further Clues:** Find offerings around the altar (tarnished religious artifacts, strange symbols) or a **journal/scroll** detailing the shrine's purpose and its connection to Magda. This journal could explicitly name the "Garden of Bones" or the ritual.

## Post-Session Questions for Players
* "What do you do now that the spiderdragon is defeated?"
* "Do you try to investigate the source of this molten energy further, or do you head back to the farms to report what you've found?"
* "What are your characters feeling/thinking after this encounter?"
