# Bad Lands

Beyond the stable regions of [[The Shattered Isles]], countless drifting isles and asteroids form the chaotic expanse known as the **Bad Lands**. These fragments roam the void in unpredictable orbits, often colliding or tearing apart before drifting onward. Navigators rarely chart them for long; the landscape changes with every passing season.

## Hazards and Inhabitants
- **Unstable Terrain** – The gravitational tides of the [[Dyson Sphere]] pull these islands haphazardly. Collisions scatter debris and reshape the area, creating constant danger for airships and explorers.
- **Deadly Creatures** – Mutated beasts born from [[Moonfall]]'s lingering energies stalk the skies and ruins. Remnants of [[Molten]] and [[Shade]] warbands still clash here, heedless of outsiders.
- **Pirates and Exiles** – Outlaws use the Bad Lands as hiding spots, striking at trade routes before retreating to their moving lairs. Whole communities of lost or banished peoples eke out survival among the wreckage.

## Ancient Ruins
The Bad Lands hold some of the most intact relics of the pre-Shattering world. Buried within shattered asteroids are lost cities, arcane machines, and forgotten caches of magic and technology. Adventurers risk life and limb for a chance to recover these treasures—though many never return.

Perilous yet alluring, the Bad Lands draw fortune seekers, scholars, and thrill‑hunters alike. Those who brave this drifting wilderness may unearth wonders capable of reshaping the fractured world—or perish amid its ever‑shifting chaos.
