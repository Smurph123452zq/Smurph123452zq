Formed in the wake of [[The Lunar Pact]], the United Mortal Pact is a
confederation of disparate peoples bound together for mutual protection. Each
island sends representatives to the floating council at [[Thaumaven]], where
matters of trade and defense are debated. No single ruler holds sway; instead,
alliances shift based on need and the persuasive power of local leaders.

The Pact is a melting pot of cultures—dwarven refugees share caverns with human
sailors and goblin artisans. This diversity fuels innovation but also frequent
arguments over resources. Organizations like the [[Stone Wardens]] and
[[Stonecarvers’ Guild]] maintain the vast tunnel networks that connect the
Pact's settlements.

Though friendly with the [[Moonlight Monarchy]] and [[Gealaí Enclave]], the
Union constantly battles raiders from the [[Bad Lands]] and remnants of the
[[New Solar Republic]]. Adventurers hired under the Pact's banner often explore
forgotten ruins or secure vital shipping lanes between the islands.
