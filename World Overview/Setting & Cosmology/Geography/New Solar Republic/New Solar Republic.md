Once a radiant civilization devoted to [[Ashqua]], the New Solar Republic now lies in ruin. A decade after its collapse in [[The Molten War]], the region remains twisted by lingering solar magic and haunted by molten husks of its former citizens. Adventurers still venture here seeking forgotten secrets and relics of divine power.

## Geography and Environment
- **Charred landscapes:** Rolling fields of blackened glass and ash dominate the countryside. Rivers run sluggish with shimmering embers, and the air shimmers with residual heat.
- **Warped by solar magic:** Surges of uncontrolled sunlight erupt from cracked ley lines, creating pockets of perpetual daylight. These areas scorch anything that lingers too long.
- **Hazards:** Unstable magma vents, blinding solar flares, and collapsing ground make travel perilous. Solar storms occasionally sweep across the isles, crackling with divine energy.

## Ruins and Structures
- **Ashqua Citadel:** Once a gleaming fortress, it now bleeds molten rock from its walls. Broken automatons patrol its halls, still attempting to defend a long-fallen empire.
- **Sunforges:** Found in shattered workshops, these once-mighty engines sputter with failing light. Their cracked cores are prized by scavengers and scholars alike.
- **Temples and obelisks:** Crumbling shrines to Ashqua dot the islands. Many still radiate faint warmth, and some whisper with the goddess’s voice when the sun sets.

## Inhabitants and Threats
- **Molten remnants:** Fragments of former citizens—now mindless, burning constructs—wander the ruins. They lash out at intruders with molten claws and searing breath.
- **Broken constructs:** Clockwork guardians and solar-powered automatons malfunction in erratic patterns, often mistaking explorers for enemies.
- **Scavengers and cults:** Opportunistic treasure hunters, rogue mage guilds, and fanatic Ashqua worshippers risk the hazards for lost knowledge or divine relics. A few survivors claim to resist Ashqua’s influence, though their motives remain unclear.

## Magical Phenomena
- **Lingering solar wells:** Pools of condensed sunlight still manifest in the deepest sanctuaries. They can empower spells—or incinerate the unprepared.
- **Divine whispers:** Some report hearing Ashqua’s voice carried on the hot winds, promising salvation or demanding obedience. Her presence is faint but undeniable.
- **Relics of power:** Sun-blessed weapons, molten-imbued armor, and fragments of ashquian scripture can be found among the wreckage, each humming with unstable magic.

## Hooks and Opportunities
- **Quest for knowledge:** Scholars seek proof of how Ashqua’s prison faltered and how her influence can be contained.
- **Lost treasures:** Ancient vaults beneath Vantress or the Ashqua Citadel may hold powerful artifacts or secrets of the Molten War.
- **Mysterious resistance:** Rumors persist of an enclave of former citizens who avoided corruption. Discovering them could reveal forgotten histories—or trigger lingering traps.
