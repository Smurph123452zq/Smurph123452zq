A large agricultural center in the fertile valleys of Críoch Skolvar. It provides much of the food for the region. The town is known for its annual harvest festival and its strong community bonds. Expect sprawling fields, barns, granaries, and a lively marketplace.
Known for its skilled "Dragon Whisperers" who can communicate with and calm the docile descendants. It might be a training center for those seeking to learn this skill.
**Overarching Themes to Incorporate:**

- **Dragon-Integrated Architecture:** Buildings should incorporate natural elements, potentially even utilizing shed dragon scales or bones in construction. Structures might be built _around_ ancient dragon nesting sites.
- **Druidic Influence:** Town layouts could reflect ley lines and sacred groves. Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.
- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated "dragon paths" through the settlements.
- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.
