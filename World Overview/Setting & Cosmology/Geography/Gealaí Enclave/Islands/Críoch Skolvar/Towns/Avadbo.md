A remote village nestled deep within a dark forest. Its inhabitants are rumored to practice ancient, secretive rituals. Outsiders are viewed with suspicion. The town is isolated and self-sufficient, relying on hunting and gathering for survival. Expect rustic homes, hidden shrines, and an air of unease. A town built into the side of a cliff, utilizing natural caves as homes and workshops. The architecture could mimic dragon dens, blending seamlessly with the landscape.

**Overarching Themes to Incorporate:**

- **Dragon-Integrated Architecture:** Buildings should incorporate natural elements, potentially even utilizing shed dragon scales or bones in construction. Structures might be built _around_ ancient dragon nesting sites.
- **Druidic Influence:** Town layouts could reflect ley lines and sacred groves. Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.
- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated "dragon paths" through the settlements.
- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.
## Demographics
- **Population:** Roughly 120 residents living in scattered cliffside homes
- **Races:** Primarily Humans and Half-Elves, with a handful of reclusive Dragonborn caretakers
- **Alignment:** Often [[Neutral]] as survival outweighs lofty ideals

## Key Locations
- **The Shrouded Glade:** A secluded clearing used for secret rituals and seasonal gatherings
- **Cliffside Workshops:** Natural caves where artisans craft tools from bone and stone
- **Watcher’s Perch:** A narrow lookout overseeing the forested approach, manned in rotation

## Important NPCs
- **Elder Caerwyn:** Keeper of the village’s rites and lore
- **Fera the Huntress:** Guides small groups through the surrounding woods
- **Orin Talonsbane:** Dragonborn guardian watching for outside threats

## Economy and Trade
- **Primary Industries:** Hunting, foraging, and small‑scale leatherworking
- **Trade Goods:** Furs, carved bone trinkets, and rare forest herbs
- **Trading Partners:** Occasional barter with [[Brigid]] or wandering druids

## Local Rumors and Conflicts
- Whispers tell of a hidden shrine deep in the forest said to awaken [[Ashqua]]’s remnants
- Some villagers fear outsiders will expose their rituals, causing friction with travelers
- A few young hunters dream of leaving to join [[The Lunar Pact]] but face scorn from elders
