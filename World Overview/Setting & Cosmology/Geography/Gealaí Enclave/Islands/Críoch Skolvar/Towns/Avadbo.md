A remote village nestled deep within a dark forest. Its inhabitants are rumored to practice ancient, secretive rituals. Outsiders are viewed with suspicion. The town is isolated and self-sufficient, relying on hunting and gathering for survival. Expect rustic homes, hidden shrines, and an air of unease. A town built into the side of a cliff, utilizing natural caves as homes and workshops. The architecture could mimic dragon dens, blending seamlessly with the landscape.

**Overarching Themes to Incorporate:**

- **Dragon-Integrated Architecture:** Buildings should incorporate natural elements, potentially even utilizing shed dragon scales or bones in construction. Structures might be built _around_ ancient dragon nesting sites.
- **Druidic Influence:** Town layouts could reflect ley lines and sacred groves. Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.
- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated "dragon paths" through the settlements.
- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.
