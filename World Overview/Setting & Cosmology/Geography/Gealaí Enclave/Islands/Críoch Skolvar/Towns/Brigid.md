[[Brigid]] is a coastal town famous for its shipbuilders and fishermen. The town is built around natural hot springs that are believed to have special powers, especially for those with dragon blood.

The buildings in Brigid use smooth stones and flowing water, making the town peaceful and respectful. It's a busy trading center where goods are exchanged with other islands. However, most people come to Brigid because of the healing springs. You’ll see lots of boats in the harbor and buildings close together that were designed based on the moon. There are also many people who work hard to protect old stories about dragons.

The town is known for its “Dragon Healers,” people who understand how to use the spring's energy to heal others. Some say the goddess [[Nerrath]] blessed these waters a long time ago, giving them special magic. 

Brigid is located in an area called [[Críoch Skolvar]], "The Border of the Fallen." The town got its name from a Celtic goddess who was known for healing and craftsmanship. Long ago, followers of [[Nerrath]] came to this place looking for peace near the springs. Later, people wounded during wars came here too.
