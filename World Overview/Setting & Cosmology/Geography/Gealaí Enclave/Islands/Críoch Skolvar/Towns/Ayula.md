Ayula is built around ancient ruins – remnants of a pre-Shattering civilization. It’s a center for scholars and historians attempting to uncover the secrets of the past. The town itself is relatively small but attracts visitors interested in archaeology and lore. Expect crumbling stone structures interwoven with newer buildings, libraries filled with dusty tomes, and a sense of mystery.
A town specializing in crafting harnesses and equipment for the docile dragons, using materials sourced sustainably from the surrounding forests. The town’s symbol could be a stylized dragon harness
**Overarching Themes to Incorporate:**

- **Dragon-Integrated Architecture:** Buildings should incorporate natural elements, potentially even utilizing shed dragon scales or bones in construction. Structures might be built _around_ ancient dragon nesting sites.
- **Druidic Influence:** Town layouts could reflect ley lines and sacred groves. Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.
- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated "dragon paths" through the settlements.
- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.
