A town built around hot springs with purported healing properties. It’s a destination for those seeking respite from illness or injury, as well as a place where herbalists and healers practice their craft. Expect bathhouses, gardens filled with medicinal plants, and a peaceful atmosphere.
A trading hub where dragon-related goods (scales, shed horns, etc.) are exchanged. The town’s layout could incorporate open-air markets with stalls specifically designed for displaying these items.
**Overarching Themes to Incorporate:**

- **Dragon-Integrated Architecture:** Buildings should incorporate natural elements, potentially even utilizing shed dragon scales or bones in construction. Structures might be built _around_ ancient dragon nesting sites.
- **Druidic Influence:** Town layouts could reflect ley lines and sacred groves. Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.
- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated "dragon paths" through the settlements.
- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.
