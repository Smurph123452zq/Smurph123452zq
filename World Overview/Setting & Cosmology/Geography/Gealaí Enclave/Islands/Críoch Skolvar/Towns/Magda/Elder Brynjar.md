To best portray Elder Brynjar’s initial request and subtly foreshadow deeper threats, we can weave in several elements during “Brynjar’s Request” (30 mins):

**1. The Nature of the Agitation:** Instead of simply stating dragons are agitated, Brynjar should describe _how_ they're behaving differently. She could mention:

- “Their usual playful curiosity has turned to…restlessness. A frantic energy I haven’t witnessed in centuries.”
- "They seem disturbed by something deep within the earth itself – a tremor that resonates not just physically, but...spiritually."
- She might note they are exhibiting behaviors reminiscent of dragons affected by ancient curses or corrupted energies (drawing on lore from [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md) and [Magda](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FMagda.md)).

**2. Linking to Natural Energies & Lorekeeper Concerns:** Brynjar should emphasize the connection between dragon behavior and Magda’s natural energies, referencing her role as a Lorekeeper:

- “As Lorekeepers, we monitor the flow of energy within Magda. Lately, that flow has become…turbulent. The dragons are sensitive to these shifts.”
- She could mention studying the [Vein of Azurite](app://obsidian.md/Vein%20of%20Azurite) and noticing unusual fluctuations coinciding with the dragon’s agitation. This subtly introduces a key location and potential source of corruption.

**3. Hints of Moonfall & Deeper Disturbances:** Brynjar can express concern about the long-term effects of [Moonfall](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FMoonfall.md), linking it to the current unrest:

- “Since the debris from [Moonfall](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FMoonfall.md) fell, we’ve observed a…fragility in the ecosystem. A vulnerability that seems to be attracting something _unnatural_.”
- She might mention reports of unusual creatures emerging from deeper tunnels (as noted in [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md)) and express worry they are connected to the disturbances.

**4. Subtle Clues & Foreshadowing:**

- Brynjar could show the party a piece of corrupted flora found near an agitated dragon, hinting at a spreading influence.
- She might mention a disturbing dream or vision she experienced, referencing unsettling imagery related to darkness and imprisonment (a subtle nod to Ashqua).
- When discussing the dragons’ distress, Brynjar can express concern about a growing “shadow” over Magda, subtly foreshadowing Ashqua's awakening.

**5. The Task & Initial Investigation:** Brynjar should task the party with investigating the dragon farms and initial cave entrances (as outlined in [Outline](obsidian://open?file=Plot%2FOutline.md)), specifically asking them to:

- Observe the dragons’ behavior closely.
- Look for any signs of unusual energy or corruption.
- Report back immediately if they find anything concerning.

By incorporating these elements, we can establish a sense of unease and foreshadow the larger threats lurking beneath Magda, setting the stage for the campaign's unfolding mysteries while leveraging the detailed lore provided in the notes.




##TLDR :P
*   Brynjar should describe *how* dragons are agitated, beyond simply stating they are, mentioning restlessness, spiritual disturbance, or behaviors linked to ancient curses.
*   The agitation is connected to fluctuations in Magda’s natural energies, which Brynjar monitors as a Lorekeeper; the Vein of Azurite shows unusual activity.
*   Moonfall has created ecosystem fragility and vulnerability, potentially attracting something unnatural and leading to reports of new creatures.
*   Subtle clues like corrupted flora, disturbing dreams/visions, and concern about a growing “shadow” foreshadow deeper threats (like Ashqua).
*   The party is tasked with investigating dragon farms and cave entrances, observing for unusual energy or corruption and reporting back immediately.
