A port town that serves as a gateway to either [[First Light]] or [[Mirrothal]] . It's a rough-and-tumble place known for its smugglers, mercenaries, and shady dealings. Expect taverns filled with hardened sailors, back alleys teeming with criminals, and a general sense of danger.A coastal town where dragon descendants are used for transportation along the shoreline, ferrying goods and passengers between settlements. The harbor would feature specialized docks designed for these creatures.
**Overarching Themes to Incorporate:**

- **Dragon-Integrated Architecture:** Buildings should incorporate natural elements, potentially even utilizing shed dragon scales or bones in construction. Structures might be built _around_ ancient dragon nesting sites.
- **Druidic Influence:** Town layouts could reflect ley lines and sacred groves. Temples dedicated to nature spirits and the ancient dragons would be common.
- **Beast-of-Burden Integration:** The towns should visibly accommodate the docile dragon descendants – stables, specialized care facilities, perhaps even designated "dragon paths" through the settlements.
- **Remembrance of Sacrifice:** Memorials and shrines dedicated to the dragons who sacrificed during [[The Lunar Pact]] should be prominent in each town.
