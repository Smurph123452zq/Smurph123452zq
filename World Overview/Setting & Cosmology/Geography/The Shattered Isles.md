The Shattered Isles are contained within a titanic Dyson Sphere. Most islands drift in stable regions held by five great nations.

### Regions
1. [[Moonlight Monarchy]] – Twilight forests and fortified keeps where Nerrath's followers guard ancient lunar secrets.
2. [[New Solar Republic]] – Once radiant cities devoted to Ashqua; now a corrupted ghost land after its populace perished in [[The Molten War]].
3. [[Zonnewij Isels]] – A once-prosperous realm now tainted by Moonfall, rife with warped creatures and unstable magic.
4. [[Gealaí Enclave]] – Verdant islands shaped by druidic traditions and dragonkin, their architecture woven into nature.
5. [[United Mortal Pact]] – A coalition of diverse peoples united for survival after [[The Lunar Pact]].

Other islands lacking fixed positions are collectively known as the [[Bad Lands]].

This world currently reveres two gods:
- [[Ashqua]] – Goddess of the Sun
- [[Nerrath]] – Goddess of the Moon
