## Personality

Once a warm and nurturing ruler, Nerrath grew sorrowful and distant after the war against [[Ashqua]]. She is wise, reserved, and fiercely protective of balance, but her compassion remains. Though her physical form was lost, her influence lingers, whispering through the wind and guiding lost souls.
## Abilities and Skills

- **[[Lunar Dominion]]:** Controls moonlight and shadows, granting calm and serenity to the world.
- **[[Veil of Night]]:** Can cloak regions in protective darkness, shielding them from [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] burning gaze.
- **[[Frozen Moonlight]]:** Manipulates ice and cold, capable of encasing enemies in unbreakable frost.
- **[[Dreamwalking]]:** Can enter the dreams of mortals, guiding them with visions and warnings.

## Equipment

- **[[The Crescent Diadem]]:** A relic that once granted her full access to the moon’s power, now lost.
- **[[Silvered Blades of Twilight]]:** Twin curved daggers forged from starlight, wielded before her sacrifice.

### Classes
- **College of Valor Bard**:Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.
- **Oath of Redemption Paladin**: The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk. These paladins face evil creatures in the hope of turning their foes to the light, and they slay their enemies only when such a deed will clearly save other lives. Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers. While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, paladins who swear this oath bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear. Yet the redeemers still pray that, one day, even creatures of wickedness will invite their own redemption.
## History

Nerrath ascended alongside her sister, [[Ashqua]], thanks to the aid of the [[Unwritten]]. As ruler of the Night Kingdom, she maintained the balance between day and night. However, as [[Ashqua]] descended into tyranny, Nerrath fought to preserve the world's equilibrium, leading to [[The Eclipse Wars]]**.

During the War of the Infinite Eclipse, Nerrath fought against her sister, [[Ashqua]], to restore balance. After [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] fall, Nerrath agreed to the **United Mortal Pact**, a solemn agreement between her, the ancient dragons, and the mortals.
## Relationships

- **[[Ashqua]] (Sister, Goddess of the Sun):** Once beloved, now a fallen adversary sealed away.
    
- **The [[Unwritten]]:** Aiding force in her ascension, but now silent.
    
- **The [[Lunar Court]]:** A group of devoted followers who seek to maintain her legacy.
## Trivia

- It is said that when the moon is at its fullest, Nerrath’s whispers can be heard in the wind.

- Her scattered essence manifests as luminous, ghostly figures known as Moon Shades.

- Some believe that if [[Ashqua|Ashqua's]] seal weakens, Nerrath’s power will return in full.



## **The Lost Fragments of Nerrath**

Though her body was gone, **Nerrath was not truly dead.**

Her essence **was divided into five sacred relics**, each containing a part of her divine power:

- **The Eyes of Nerrath** – Granting foresight and the ability to see into the dreams of mortals.
- **The Mouth of Nerrath** – A voice of prophecy, speaking forgotten truths.
- **The Heart of Nerrath** – A beacon of balance, pulsing with lunar power.
- **The Body of Nerrath** – An unbreakable vessel, containing the strength of her divine will.
- **The Head of Nerrath** – Holding the last fragments of her godly intellect and wisdom.

Each piece is **an artifact of immense power**, but together, they hold an even greater secret: **if all five are found, Nerrath could return.** She would no longer be bound to the divine realm. She could **walk the mortal world once more.**
