# Leaders of the Shattered Isles

The nations of the Shattered Isles rely on strong figures to hold their fractured realms together. Below are the current leaders recognized across the world—excluding the fallen [[New Solar Republic]].

- [[Arathiel Moonshadow]] – High Queen ruling the [[Moonlight Monarchy]] from [[Thraben]]
- [[Rhiannon Oakhaven]] – Archdruid guiding the [[Gealaí Enclave]] from [[Luchtaine]]
- [[Severin Vermund]] – Lord Admiral commanding the fleets of the [[Zonnewij Isels]] from [[Dämmerung]]
- [[Torin Stoneforge]] – High Speaker representing the [[United Mortal Pact]] in [[Thaumaven]]

These leaders shape politics and alliances in the wake of [[The Molten War]] and ongoing threats from the [[Bad Lands]].
