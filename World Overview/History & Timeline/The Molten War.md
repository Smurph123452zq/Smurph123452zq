## Date

Approximately a decade after [[Moonfall]]

## Summary

As [[Ashqua]]'s prison waned, the [[New Solar Republic]] declared war on the [[Moonlight Monarchy]].  
For ten years her whispers twisted citizens into [[Molten]] thralls, turning them against their own.  
Fighting raged in the skies and across [[Châteaufeu]], with battles flaring in [[Chute Soleil]], [[Vante]], [[Ulvenwald]], and [[Davin Port]].  
Later clashes engulfed [[Hallowhenge]] and [[Thraben]]—the Monarchy's capital.  
A band of heroes eventually disrupted Ashqua's hold, tipping the scales in favor of the Moonlight Monarchy.  
Their victory led to the complete destruction of the New Solar Republic.

## Narrative

Border clashes soon gave way to open war as Ashqua's whispers drove the Republic to fanatic fury.  
[[Aurene Candra]], [[Dren]], [[Din Strider]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Mumblebeard]], [[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Theer]], and [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] answered the Monarchy's call.  
They discovered entire legions melted into searing soldiers, their minds shackled to Ashqua's will.  
During the final siege, [[Mumblebeard]] wielded the [[Nerrath#The Heart of Nerrath|Heart of Nerrath]], its lunar radiance shielding the group from Ashqua's molten fury.  
With Ashqua's grip broken, the Moonlight forces surged forward and wiped the Republic from the map.  
The decade-long war ended with Ashqua weakened and her molten armies scattered to the winds.
