## Date

Approximately a decade after [[Moonfall]]

## Summary

As [[Ashqua]]'s prison waned, the [[New Solar Republic]] declared war on the [[Moonlight Monarchy]].
For ten years her whispers twisted citizens into [[Molten]] thralls, turning them against their own.
Fighting raged in the skies and across [[Châteaufeu]].
Battles flared in [[Chute Soleil]], [[Vante]], [[Ulvenwald]], and [[Davin Port]].
Later clashes engulfed [[Hallowhenge]] and [[Thraben]]—the Monarchy's capital.
The heroes fought tirelessly to shatter her control, ending the Republic at last.

## Narrative

Border clashes soon gave way to open war as Ashqua's whispers drove the Republic to fanatic fury.
[[Aurene Candra]], [[Dren]], [[Din Strider]], [[Felladrian]], [[Flux]], [[Igni]], [[Mumblebeard]]
[[Narazir]], [[Okami]], [[Orin Talonsbane]], [[Theer]], and [[Ventri Gale-Thunder]] answered the Monarchy's call.
They discovered entire legions melted into searing soldiers, their minds shackled to Ashqua's will.
During the final siege, [[Mumblebeard]] wielded the [[Nerrath#The Heart of Nerrath|Heart of Nerrath]].
Its lunar radiance shielded the group from Ashqua's molten fury.
With Ashqua's grip broken, the Moonlight forces surged forward and wiped the Republic from the map.
The decade-long war ended with Ashqua weakened and her molten armies scattered to the winds.
