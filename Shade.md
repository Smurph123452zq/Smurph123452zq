### **Shade**

Shades are the **cursed revenants of the Lunar warriors**, reborn through [[Nerrath|Nerrath's]] sorrow and defiance. Forged from **shadow, frost, and the lingering essence of the fallen**, they exist as a counterforce to [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] blazing [[Molten]]. Neither living nor truly dead, they are spectral remnants, **cloaked in cold mist and bound by an undying will to fight**.

### **Transformation and Creation**

Unlike the [[Molten]], who are consumed by fire and corruption, Shades are created through **[[Nerrath|Nerrath's]] embrace of darkness and ice**. The process is not one of slow decay but **a violent resurgence**—a soul called back from death, reshaped into something both haunting and unnatural.

- **Death and Rebirth** – When a warrior falls under the moon’s gaze, their lingering spirit is drawn into the cold mist. If they are deemed worthy, ice and shadow knit them back together.
- **Body of Frost and Void** – Shades are no longer bound by flesh. Their forms are **half-substantial**, shifting between **frozen armor and spectral mist**, their bodies always on the edge of dissolving into shadow.
- **Mind of Echoes** – Shades retain fragments of their former selves, but their emotions are dulled, their thoughts distant whispers. They exist for one purpose: to oppose the Molten and maintain balance in the eternal war of fire and ice.

### **Physical Appearance**

Shades vary in form, shaped by the strength of their spirit and the depth of their connection to [[Nerrath]]. Some still resemble **armored warriors**, their bodies rimed with frost, while others **have lost all shape**, appearing only as shifting, jagged silhouettes of shadow and cold.

The most ancient among them are **nothing but void and frost**, faceless specters with glowing, ice-blue eyes—**ghosts of a war that never truly ended**.

### **Types of Shades**

- **[[Mistborn Stalkers]]** – Fast-moving hunters that flicker in and out of sight, striking from the fog before vanishing again.
- **[[Frostbound Husks]]** – Heavy, armored Shades with jagged ice blades. Their presence saps the warmth from the air, freezing enemies solid.
- **[[Wraithborn Knights]]** – Ethereal warriors wielding weapons of solid moonlight, striking with precision before dissolving into mist.
- **[[Void-Touched Reapers]]** – Beings of pure shadow and ice, leaving behind trails of absolute cold. They consume heat itself, turning the battlefield into a frozen graveyard.
- **[[Shroudcallers]]** – Shades who have transcended physical form, manipulating the battlefield by summoning spectral frost and unnatural darkness.

### **Behavior and Combat Tactics**

Shades **do not march—they drift, they whisper, they strike from the mist**. Their battles are not **raging infernos**, but **cold, methodical engagements** where the air itself turns against their enemies. They **sap heat, extinguish flames, and drain the will to fight**, their presence alone enough to frost weapons and still beating hearts.

While [[Molten]] charge with reckless fury, Shades prefer to **isolate, weaken, and consume**. A battlefield overtaken by Shades is eerily **silent**, save for the crackling of ice and the distant echoes of the dead.
### Resources and Harvesting

- **Shade Essence**: Captured using enchanted crystals as the Shade dissipates. Forms [[Magical Resources#Frostbloom Crystal]] or brews potions that grant invisibility in dim light for 1 minute (once per long rest).
- **Frozen Tears**: Small icy beads collected from battlefields. Worn as charms, they grant resistance to fire damage for one round after taking cold damage.
