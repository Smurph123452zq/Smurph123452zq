#### Traits
- **Luminous Shade.** The Broodmoth sheds dim light in a 30‑foot radius and can hide in darkness as if lightly obscured.
- **Shade Flight.** It can squeeze through openings as small as 1 inch wide without slowing.
- **Spectral Rebirth.** When a creature without a flying speed dies within 60 feet of the Broodmoth, it rises on the next round with 1 hit point and a spectral pair of wings under the Broodmoth's control. These shades crumble to dust after 1 hour or when reduced to 0 hit points again.

#### Actions
- **Multiattack.** The Shade-Broodmoth makes two claw attacks.
- **Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
- **Dread Gaze (Recharge 5–6).** The Broodmoth targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. The target can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

This towering, moth-like apparition haunts the misty cliffs of [[Zonnewij Isels]] and drifts across #location/Virazorn. Its wings glow with eerie luminescence while shadows coil around its body. Legends whisper that the Shade-Broodmoth is a specter drawn from forgotten magic, able to command the spirits of those who fall beneath its wings.
