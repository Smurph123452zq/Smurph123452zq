- **Magda Integration:** Glimmerwings are kept as companions by artisans and [Lorekeepers](obsidian://open?file=Lore%2FLorekeepers.md). Their glittering dust is used in crafting intricate jewelry and illuminating workshops. The [Glimmering Grotto](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FGlimmering%20Grotto.md) often has swarms of them flitting about, adding to the ambiance. They’re considered lucky charms and symbols of creativity.
- **Economy:** Shed scales are collected for use in dyes and pigments.
