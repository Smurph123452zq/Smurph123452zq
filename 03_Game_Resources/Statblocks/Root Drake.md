**Root Whip.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage and the target is restrained until the end of its next turn. A creature can use its action to make a DC 12 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.

**Spore Cloud.** The Root Drake exhales a cloud of poisonous spores in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Reactions

**Entangling Roots.** (Optional) When a creature moves within 5 feet of the Root Drake, it can use its reaction to attempt to restrain that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of its next turn.

**Ecology:** Root Drakes are unusual plant creatures resembling miniature dragons, often found in rural areas and farmlands. They have a symbiotic relationship with farmers, enhancing crop yields through their presence. In some cultures, they are revered as guardians of the harvest or seen as embodiments of nature’s bounty. Their venomous bite and spore clouds serve as defense mechanisms against threats to the farmland they protect.
