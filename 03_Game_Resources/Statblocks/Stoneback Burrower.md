**Traits:**

- **Symbiotic Flora.** Fungal spores cling to the Stoneback Burrower’s scales, spreading as it moves and enriching the soil.
- **Stone Camouflage.** The dragon has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in rocky terrain.

**Actions:**

- **Breath Weapon (Recharge 5–6).** The dragon exhales a concussive blast of air in a 20-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Creatures in the area must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The force can also loosen rocks, potentially causing minor cave-ins (DM’s discretion).
- **Claw.** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage.



- **Stats:** Medium size, Strength & Constitution focused. Breath weapon is a concussive blast of air that can loosen rock or create small cave-ins.
- **Traits:** Heavily armored scales resembling stone formations, excellent diggers, symbiotic relationship with cave flora – they spread fungal spores as they burrow.
- **Magda Integration:** Stoneback Burrowers are essential to maintaining and expanding the cave systems. [Stone Wardens](obsidian://open?file=Worldbuilding%2FStone%20Wardens.md) partner with them to create new tunnels and reinforce existing ones. They’re treated with respect for their strength and utility, often “paid” in mineral-rich soil or specially cultivated fungi.
- **Economy:** Their digging helps uncover new veins of minerals, boosting the city's mining operations.
