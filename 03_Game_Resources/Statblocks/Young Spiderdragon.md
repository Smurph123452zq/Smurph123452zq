### Traits

**Magic Resistance.** The spiderdragon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Spider Climb.** The spiderdragon can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.

**Web Walker.** The spiderdragon ignores movement restrictions caused by webbing.

### Actions

**Multiattack.** The spiderdragon makes one **Bite** and one **Claw** attack.

**Bite.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.

**Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) slashing damage.

**Spiderling Breath** (Recharge 5–6).  
The spiderdragon exhales venomous spiderlings in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw**, taking **27 (6d8)** damage, split evenly between piercing and poison damage, or half as much on a successful save.

### Bonus Actions

**Stifling Webs** (Recharge 5–6).  
The spiderdragon spins a 20-foot cube of strong, sticky webbing in an area adjacent to itself. The webbing lasts for 1 minute, is difficult terrain, and lightly obscures the area.

A creature that starts its turn in the webbing or enters it must succeed on a **DC 14 Dexterity saving throw** or become **restrained** while in the web. A restrained creature can use its action to escape with a **DC 14 Strength check**.

Each 5-foot cube of the web has AC 10 and 5 HP and is destroyed if it takes acid, fire, or slashing damage.

**Lore Snippet:**  
Spiderdragons are ambush predators, weaving intricate webs amongst ruins and canyons. They exhibit a disturbing fascination with collecting remnants of lost civilizations, adorning their lairs with shattered artifacts and the bones of past explorers. Though driven by base instinct, older specimens display cunning intelligence, occasionally forming unsettling alliances with desperate outcasts or cults worshipping forgotten powers.
