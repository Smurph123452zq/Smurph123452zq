#### Traits
- **Tethered to the Shrine.** While within the Garden of Bones, the Khenra has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
- **Fragmented Memory.** A creature that speaks to the Khenra in a tongue it knew in life may make a DC 11 Charisma (Persuasion) check to calm it, preventing hostility for 1 minute.

#### Actions
- **Scimitar.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
- **Moonlit Lament (Recharge 6).** The skeleton utters a haunting phrase from the Eclipse Wars. Each creature of its choice within 15 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the start of its next turn.
