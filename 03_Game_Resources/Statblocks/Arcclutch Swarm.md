***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and it can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.  

***Electric Sense.*** The swarm detects sources of metal or active spellcasting within 60 ft.  

***Leyline Tether.*** As a bonus action, the swarm can relay visual and auditory information to [[Spark-Shifter]] across any distance on the same plane, provided no planar barrier exists between them.  

#### Actions
***Static Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 0 ft., one creature in the swarm’s space. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) lightning damage, or 3 (1d6) lightning damage if the swarm has half its hit points or fewer, plus 7 (2d6) lightning damage.  

***Lightning Burst (Recharge 5–6).*** The swarm unleashes a cone of crackling power. Each creature in a 15‑foot cone must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. After the burst, swirling rain and wind heavily obscure the area within 30 ft. of the swarm until the end of its next turn.  

***Stormcaller Aura.*** While the swarm has more than half its hit points, creatures that start their turn within 10 ft. of it take 2 (1d4) lightning damage and have disadvantage on concentration checks until the start of their next turn. A creature that takes lightning damage inside the aura must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 ft. away from the swarm.

### Lore
Arcclutch Swarms are metallic-thoraxed lightning gnats born from arcs of charged mana in rupture-laden skies. These motes were first coaxed into coherence by the enigmatic [[Spark-Shifter]], who reshaped the sparks themselves into obedient drones.  
- **Origins:** When leyline pressure vents into the open air, micro‑elements of lightning gain a glimmer of will. The Spark-Shifter overlays this nascent will with modular clockwork, granting them shape and loyalty.  
- **Behavior:** Arcclutch Swarms flit restlessly, hunting for fresh currents. They are drawn to stormfronts, lightning rods, arcane laboratories, and anywhere the veil between the Weave and the world thins.  
- **Connection to the Spark-Shifter:** Each swarm functions as a remote eye and ear for its maker. Sparks that survive a mission carry residual data back to the Spark-Shifter, updating the entity on battlefields, weather flows, or potential sites of [[Spark-Shifter|arc‑craft]].

### Tactics & Abilities
- **Swarm Behavior:** Individually weak, they overwhelm foes by smothering them in a cloud of electric wings. Their tiny forms slip through armor gaps and gear seams.  
- **Lightning Burst:** When commanded or threatened, the swarm forms a brief circular circuit and detonates, scattering enemies and obscuring the field in a sheet of rain.  
- **Stormcaller Aura:** Sustained overcharge forces the air around the swarm to hum with static, interfering with concentration and pushing enemies away.  
- **Defensive Properties:** They resist most weapon blows and dissipate into harmless sparks when slain, making them difficult to harvest without specialized tools.  

### Encounter Hooks
- **Leyline Breach:** A newly opened leyline fracture releases violent storms and Arcclutch Swarms that hinder rescue efforts until the breach is sealed.  
- **Battlefield Scouts:** During war with arcane forces, swarms track troop movements, forcing adventurers to eliminate them to maintain secrecy.  
- **Controlled Storm:** The Spark-Shifter sends a massive swarm to disrupt a town’s defenses, creating a localized tempest unless the heroes disperse it quickly.  
- **Scaling Suggestions:** For higher-level parties, increase swarm size to Large and add another recharge ability (e.g., *Chain Lightning*). For lower-level play, use a reduced hit-point pool and limit Lightning Burst to once per encounter.

### Loot & Rewards
- **Arc Capacitors:** Salvageable mote-core coils function as components worth 50–100 gp to artificers or enchanters.  
- **Storm Residue:** The residual charge can be bottled for one potion of *storm resistance* (lightning) with a successful DC 15 alchemy check.  
- **Telemetry Shards:** Recoverable crystal lenses contain fragments of the Spark-Shifter’s reconnaissance; decoding them might reveal clues leading to the [[Spark-Shifter]]’s lair or a new entry in the [[Bestiary Index]].
