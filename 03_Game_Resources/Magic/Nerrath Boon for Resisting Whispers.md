# Nerrath's Moonlit Favor

Those who resist the whispers of corruption within the [[Garden of Bones]] earn the Veiled Moon's notice.

*When mind and will prevail over molten temptation, Nerrath offers a soft gleam of guidance.*

- **Recipients:** [[Skarhn]], [[Hallar]]
- **Effect:** Each gains a fleeting blessing of moonlight. For the next adventure, they have advantage on saving throws against being charmed and add **+1 Light**.
- **Flair:** A cool shimmer outlines their forms whenever shadow falls across them, a sign of Nerrath's lingering protection.
