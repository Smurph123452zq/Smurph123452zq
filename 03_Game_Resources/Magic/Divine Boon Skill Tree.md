# Divine Boon Skill Tree

tags: DivineBoon, Ashqua, Nerrath, Mechanics

The following boons allow characters to tap the opposing powers of [[Ashqua]] and [[Nerrath]].
Each tier becomes available at character levels 1, 3, 6, and 9. Boons often alter **Light**, a resource ranging from **–20** (blighted by Ashqua) to **+20** (blessed by Nerrath). Unless noted, gaining a boon adds **+1 Light**.

**Spending vs. Burning Light**

- Spending or expending Light represents temporary strain on your divine link.
- Burning Light is far more drastic: it severs your bond to the divine and ends your ability to use magic, but can fuel astonishing feats.
- Creatures that cannot generate Light may draw upon the Light of a willing ally they are touching.

## Tier 1 – Seeds of Power

1. **Ashqua – Smoldering Resolve** – Spend 2 Light to resist fear for a scene.
2. **Ashqua – Brand of the Tyrant** – Spend 1 Light to mark a foe; allies gain advantage on attacks against it for one round.

5. **Nerrath – Gentle Reprieve** – Gain 2 Light whenever you take the Dodge action in dim light.
