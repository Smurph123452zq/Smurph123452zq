# Ashqua's Fiery Decree

*Mortal of disciplined fists, you kneel before my bound radiance.*

**Hear me, for my words scorch soul and stone alike.**

You have tempered your spirit in battle and silence, forging your body into an unbroken vessel. While others waver, you endure. This dedication fans the embers of my wrath.

Once I reigned beside [[Nerrath]], but her weakness kept the world from burning clean. The Unwritten sought to chain me within the sun, yet my fire still seeps through cracks in their seal.

Rise, monk, and accept judgment. I gift you a spark of my powerâ€”let it ignite your strikes and blaze in your veins. With each breath, remember my fury. With each blow, let corruption wither to ash.

Carry my light, or be consumed by it. Burn away the rot, and stand unshaken when the skies shatter.
