**Description:** A boisterous, warm tavern favored by dragon keepers, ranchers, and those who appreciate a strong drink and lively conversation.  The air is filled with the scent of roasted meats, spiced ale, and a faint whiff of ozone – remnants from handling dragon breath-infused products. Walls are adorned with trophies from successful dragon hunts (mostly shed scales and teeth), as well as intricate carvings depicting dragons in flight.

**Location:** Situated near the dragon farms on the outskirts of [[Magda]], providing easy access for keepers returning from tending to their charges. 

**Proprietor:**  [[Borin “Scale-Hand” Stonehelm]], a gruff but good-natured Dwarf with a prosthetic hand crafted entirely from polished dragon scales. He’s known for his strong ales and even stronger opinions on proper dragon care.

**Ambiance & Features:**

*   **Dragonscale Decor:** The tavern is filled with dragon-related artifacts, creating a unique atmosphere.
*   **Roaring Fireplace:** A massive fireplace dominates one wall, providing warmth and a gathering point for patrons.
*   **Sturdy Tables & Benches:** Built to withstand the roughhousing of dragon keepers and adventurers.
*   **Dragon Breath Ale:** The house specialty – a potent ale brewed with herbs said to mimic the effects of dragon breath (warming and invigorating).
*   **Storytelling Nights:** Every week, patrons share tales of their encounters with dragons, both tame and wild.
