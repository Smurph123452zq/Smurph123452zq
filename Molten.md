### **Molten**

Molten are beings that have been corrupted by [[Ashqua]], their bodies and souls consumed by her relentless, burning will. No longer truly human—or whatever they once were—they exist as **living embers of her wrath**, bound in eternal servitude to the imprisoned sun goddess.

### **Transformation and Corruption**

The process of becoming Molten is not instantaneous. [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] influence **warps both flesh and spirit**, altering her victims in stages:

- **Early Corruption**: Skin becomes feverishly hot, veins glow like smoldering coals, and the afflicted develop an unnatural resistance to fire. They begin hearing [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] whispers.
- **Mid Corruption**: Hair burns away, flesh blackens and cracks, revealing molten light beneath. Their movements become erratic, driven by bursts of flame. They lose their identity, speaking only in [[Ashqua|Ashqua’s]] name.
- **Complete Transformation**: The last shreds of their former selves are burned away. Their bodies become **charred husks of obsidian and molten rock**, their eyes searing like miniature suns. They no longer think—only obey.

### **Physical Appearance**

Molten beings vary depending on the depth of their corruption. Some retain **humanoid silhouettes**, while others have melted into **unrecognizable forms of flowing magma and charred bone**. The most powerful among them become **pure living flame**, shedding all traces of a solid form.

### **Types of Molten**

- **[[Molten Thralls]]** – Newly turned, still bearing remnants of their former selves. Their flesh is cracked and burning, but they retain vague memories, making them hesitant in battle.
- **[[Blazing Husks]]** – Fully transformed warriors of [[Ashqua]], their bodies reduced to little more than charred frames filled with molten energy. They explode upon death.
- **[[Infernal Stalkers]]** – Faster, more agile Molten that leave fiery footprints as they hunt. Their claws can ignite the air itself.
- **[[Molten Titans]]** – Towering monstrosities that radiate unbearable heat. They wield weapons of molten metal and leave rivers of fire in their wake.
- **[[Ashbound Priests]]** – Those who willingly gave themselves to[[Ashqua]], now her prophets of flame. They channel her divine fire into devastating rituals.

### **Behavior and Combat Tactics**

Molten do not feel pain or fear. They attack **relentlessly, spreading flame wherever they tread**. Some **burn out quickly in violent bursts**, while others smolder slowly, enduring strikes that would fell mortal warriors. Their presence alone **warps the battlefield**, causing metal to soften, wood to ignite, and the air to shimmer with heat.
