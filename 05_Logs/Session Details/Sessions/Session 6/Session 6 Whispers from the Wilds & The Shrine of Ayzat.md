## Session 6: Whispers from the Wilds & The Shrine of Ayzat #session_plan #shatteredisles

### Current Situation
The [[Unexpected Company]] bask in brief respite within [[Magda]] after cleansing the [[Garden of Bones Shrine]]. [[Eldar Grelamin]] carries the smoldering [[Molten Hearthstone]] bound to a rod of zenithite; its whispers sharpen and the air grows hotter each day. [[Hallar]] and [[Skarhn Runefall]] still glow with [[Nerrath's Moonlit Favor]], while rumors of spark‑shifters and hostile beasts spread among farmers. [[Ashqua]]'s command drives the party south to the hidden [[Shrine of Ayzat]] and the wilds beyond town.

### Session Goals
- Track the source of corrupted wildlife and spark‑shifter migrations.
- Navigate the Whispering Wilds and uncover the entrance to the [[Shrine of Ayzat]].
- Decide how to handle the searing influence of the [[Molten Hearthstone]].
- Hint at looming powers drawn by either [[Ashqua]] or the land’s festering corruption.

### Scene Breakdown
1. **Ashqua's Echoes in Magda** — *20 min*  
   - **Setup:** At dawn the heartstone flares, setting a stable on the edge of town ablaze. Stone Speaker [[Hemlock]] and [[Borin Stonehelm]] plead for aid while whispers promise Eldar greater power.  
   - **Hazards:** spreading fire, frightened root drakes, heartstone whispers tempting PCs to unleash it.  
   - **Skill Checks:** Wisdom save DC 13 vs whispers; Athletics/Animal Handling DC 12 to calm or restrain beasts; Persuasion DC 12 to soothe panicked townsfolk.  
   - **Options:**  
     - *Roleplay:* earn Hemlock’s trust by revealing the heartstone or hide it and deflect blame.  
     - *Combat:* if ignored, a corrupted drake bursts free (use giant lizard stat block with fire damage).

2. **Whispering Wilds Trek** — *30 min*  
   - **Setup:** Following Farmer [[Tim]]’s map, the party enters forested ravines where voices echo their doubts. The canopy distorts time; shadows lengthen unnaturally.  
   - **Hazards:** spark‑shifter swarm (treat as *swarm of insects* with lightning), patches of hallucinogenic shimmer shrooms, unstable terrain.  
   - **Skill Checks:** Group Survival DC 14 to stay on course; Perception DC 15 to notice illusory paths; Dexterity save DC 13 against lightning bursts.  
   - **Options:**  
     - *Roleplay:* Lucky senses a thrum of pain from the land—calming an animal with *Speak with Animals* reveals it “hungers for the sun.”  
     - *Combat:* three corrupted boars (CR 1/2) charge; the party may subdue to learn more or slay them to harvest tusks.

3. **Whistletooth's Bargain** — *20 min*  
   - **Setup:** The hermit [[Whistletooth]] steps from a tree hollow, antlers woven with chimes. He demands a rare herb or a drop of heartstone magma for guidance.  
   - **Hazards:** he commands minor fey; refusing him may summon thorny vines (treat as *entangle*).  
   - **Skill Checks:** Persuasion or Intimidation DC 14 to negotiate; Nature DC 13 to identify the silverleaf herb he wants; Insight DC 12 to sense his fear of the shrine.  
   - **Options:**  
     - *Roleplay:* trade goods and gain a sketch map of the Gazaleth cliffs, plus a whispered warning: “Regret walks before the blade.”  
     - *Combat:* attacking him calls two **spectral regrets** (use *specter* stats) that feed on sorrow.

4. **Threshold of the Shrine** — *40 min*  
   - **Setup:** Jagged Gazaleth cliffs rise ahead; a waterfall veils a stone arch etched with sun‑and‑moon sigils. The air hums and moments slip—each step may skip or repeat time.  
   - **Hazards:** slick rocks (Athletics/Acrobatics DC 13), time‑distortion (Wisdom save DC 14 or lose/gain 1 round), guardian spirits of regret.  
   - **Skill Checks:** Religion or Arcana DC 15 to align runes; Investigation DC 12 to spot a hidden lever behind the falls.  
   - **Options:**  
     - *Roleplay:* offering a memory or treasured item pacifies the spirits, granting safe entry.  
     - *Combat:* two **regret wraiths** (use *wight* without weapons) emerge if runes are disturbed.  
     - *Exploration:* solving the puzzle reveals a passage and a glimpse of a statue clutching a real blade bathed in moonlight.

### Object Lore & Leads
- **Corrupted Boar Tusks:** still warm with zenithite taint; may be forged into fire‑resistant tools.  
- **Whistletooth's Sketch Map:** points toward hidden alcoves; marked with symbols resembling Ashqua’s sigil.  
- **Chrono Bloom Seeds:** fragile flowers near the shrine that open only when both sun and moonlight touch them—useful for divination or time magic.  
- **Ayzat's Sun‑Steel Blade:** glimpsed within the shrine; said to sever corruption yet risks drawing [[Ashqua]]'s direct gaze.

### Closing Roleplay Questions
- What whisper from the wilds unsettled you most, and why?  
- How do the blessings of [[Ashqua]] or [[Nerrath]] influence your choices as you near the shrine?  
- What are you willing to sacrifice to cleanse the corruption spreading from the [[Molten Hearthstone]]?

### Aftermath
- Cleansing or exploiting the heartstone will alter Magda’s fate—contain it and wildlife calms, unleash it and Ashqua’s zealots may arrive.  
- Securing Whistletooth’s aid earns an ally; spurning him turns the hermit into a future obstacle who spreads rumors about the party.  
- Opening the shrine invites visions of the Eclipse Wars and may accelerate the spark‑shifter migration, setting the stage for larger regional threats.
