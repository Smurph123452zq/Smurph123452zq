# Session 5: Return to Magda

## Key Threads
- The molten corruption from the heartstone threatens Magda
- Restless Khenra hint at lost Nerrath relics
- Ashqua cultists may seek the Heartstone or its shards


## Purpose & Tone
The party emerges from the [[Garden of Bones Shrine]] burdened with corrupted relics and questions. Returning to [[Magda]], they must decide whom to trust with the truth while the town grapples with unease and strange dreams. The tone is cautious yet hopeful – an opportunity for respite, investigation, and moral choices.

## Scene Outline
1. **Arrival at the Gates** – A tense welcome as [[Stone Wardens]] check for signs of corruption. Rumors of warped livestock spread fear among townsfolk.
2. **Reporting to [[Elder Brynjar]]** – She listens carefully to the party’s account of the Heartstone. Depending on their actions, she might urge secrecy, seek ways to cleanse the shrine, or question their judgment.
3. **Community Reactions** – Interactions with local NPCs (craftsfolk, farmers, patrons at [[The Root & Vine]]) reveal growing paranoia and nightmares influenced by the Heartstone’s residue. A few individuals display suspicious zeal for [[Ashqua]].
4. **Investigating Leads** – Players may examine their loot (Heartstone shards, obsidian tablet) with help from [[Lorekeepers]] or [[Stonecarvers’ Guild]] members. They could uncover references to Nerrath’s lost relics or hints that Ashqua’s cult is active nearby.
5. **Complication or Chase** – News arrives of a stranger spreading fiery sermons in the Grotto (potentially [[Brother Clastor]] or another zealot). Confronting this figure may trigger a heated debate or a sudden skirmish.
6. **Cliffhanger Choice** – The session ends as the party learns of a missing villager or a disturbance at a nearby farm. Are these results of the Heartstone, or evidence of cult activity? They must decide where to investigate next.

## Optional Scenes
- **Moonlit Vigil** – A quiet memorial for the fallen Khenra offers a chance to commune with [[Nerrath]], granting visions of other scattered fragments.
- **Rival Faction Approach** – A merchant from the [[Stonecarvers’ Guild]] offers to buy molten relics, insisting they can forge them into protective wards. Do the players sell or safeguard these items?

## NPC Spotlight
- **Elder Brynjar** – Wise leader torn between caution and the need for answers.
- **Old Man Hemlock** – Innkeeper and herbalist who senses the party’s unease and shares rumors about restless spirits.
- **Brother Clastor** – Charismatic preacher whose devotion to Ashqua might sway fearful townsfolk unless the party intervenes.

## Moral Dilemma
Magda’s council debates whether to seal off the Garden entirely or exploit its molten energy for defense. The players can influence this decision, weighing short-term protection against long-term corruption.

## Possible Encounter
A group of townsfolk, riled up by Brother Clastor, accuse the party of bringing doom upon Magda. This confrontation could become a tense debate or escalate into a brief brawl, testing the heroes’ diplomacy and restraint.
