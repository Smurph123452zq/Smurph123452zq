## 📖 Session Summary

In Session 5 the party returned to the caverns beneath [[Magda]] and entered the eerie [[Garden of Bones]]—a Moon‑Cult burial ground from before the Eclipse Wars. There they defeated mutated spiders and a juvenile [[Spider Dragon]] that had been nesting among ancient bones. Blue zenithite crystals channeled molten corruption throughout the ruins, culminating in a blazing [[Molten Hearthstone]]. Monk [[Eldar Grelamin]] seized the Hearthstone and was seared by divine fire, gaining an audience with the Solar goddess [[Ashqua]] . She granted him a burning boon—allowing him to spend light points to hurl unarmed strikes at range—and pointed him toward a hidden shrine south of Magda where a statue of High Priestess [[Ayzat]] holds a **real** sword. The Hearthstone remained a source of corruption, so Eldar fashioned a zenithite‑handled rod to carry it safely.

After escaping the Garden the adventurers brought evidence of their kills to Stone Speaker [[Hemlock]] and Elder [[Brinyar]], collected their bounties and adopted the group name “[[Unexpected Company]].” They learned that mutated creatures were not the only trouble: spark‑shifters—swarms of tiny electrical flies—were migrating south and docile beasts were becoming aggressive. A farmer named [[Farmer Tim]] directed them to [[Hemlock]], and soon the party returned to the surface where they were promised a larger reward from the Stone‑Carvers Guild in three days. They divvied up 2 550 gp (including a party fund) and each earned an acquisition check for an uncommon item.

The group celebrated at the tavern [[Dragon's Rest]], run by one‑armed dwarf [[Borin Stonehelm]] and his wife [[Evelyn Stonehelm]]. They drank Emberfang Reserve, swapped stories and recruited a new ally—a swamp‑dwelling wrestler named Derek—while Lucky saw visions of people’s inner light after ingesting “shimmer shrooms” stolen by glimmer‑wing faeries. Rumours circulated: Borin once lost his arm and tribe fighting an ancient dragon; a hidden shrine lies south of Magda; and an ancient stone dragon may slumber on a distant island. During downtime the heroes smoked spider‑dragon meat, wrestled drakes for fun, tinkered with magical items and pondered their next move. They decided to investigate why animals are behaving strangely and to seek the shrine of High Priestess Izat, leaving further adventures for the next session.

## 🧭 Locations Explored

- **[[Garden of Bones]]** #location — An ancient Moon‑Cult burial ground deep beneath [[Magda]]. The ruins are littered with skeletal remains and bathed in a blue glow from zenithite veins. Molten corruption flows through the area, twisting wildlife into molten horrors and culminating in a blazing [[Molten Hearthstone]] at the centre. Eldar’s divine encounter here hints that the place is still sacred to [[Ashqua]].
    
- **[[Magda]]** #location — A frontier settlement in the Galali Enclave. It serves as a hub for miners and farmers and is currently plagued by unusually aggressive beasts and spark‑shifter swarms. The party returned here to claim their reward and recuperate. Notable places include the taverns [[Dragon's Rest]] and Root & Vine, the Stone‑Carvers Guild and the local farmers’ fields.
    
- **[[Dragon's Rest]]** #location — A cozy tavern owned by [[Borin Stonehelm]] and his wife [[Evelyn Stonehelm]]. Its walls are decorated with draconic motifs, and Borin’s long braided beard sweeps the floor. Here the party drank Emberfang Reserve, shared tales of the spider‑dragon fight, and learned of Borin’s past as a wanderer who lost his arm fighting an ancient dragon.
    
- **[[Root & Vine]]** #location — Another tavern in Magda. The party chose Dragon’s Rest instead, but Root & Vine is available for future visits.
    
- **[[Molten Hearthstone]]** #location #artifact — A blazing orb of molten stone found at the centre of the Garden of Bones. It radiates intense heat and corrupting whispers; anyone touching it suffers fire damage and exhaustion. Eldar’s contact with the Hearthstone triggered an audience with [[Ashqua]] and allowed him to channel light into ranged strikes. Though encased in a zenithite handle, the Hearthstone continues to drip magma and corrupt nearby life until properly dealt with.
    
- **[[Hidden Shrine of High Priestess Ayzat ]]** #location #questhook — According to [[Ashqua]]’s message, a secret shrine to High Priestess [[Ayzat]] lies south of Magda near [[Gazaleth]]. The statue of [[Ayzat]] consort holds a real sword, a relic of the Solar Faith. The party plans to seek this shrine to obtain the weapon or learn more about Ashqua’s plans.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 NPCs Encountered

- **[[Ashqua]]** #npc #lore — A Solar deity of disciplined fists. Through the Hearthstone she addressed Eldar, chastising the broken world and granting him a spark of her power. She urged him to “burn away the rot” and hinted that a shrine dedicated to High Priestess [[Ayzat]] holds a worthy weapon. Her influence pulls Eldar’s attention toward the New Solar Republic at [[Ashqua Citadel]] and sets the stage for future quests.
    
- **[[Stone Speaker Hemlock]]** #npc — A dwarven authority in Magda’s Stone‑Carvers Guild. Hemlock contracted the party to clear mutated creatures from the caves so he could work safely. He was surprised by the presence of a spider dragon but promised to arrange a proper reward through the guild. He also warns of unusual wildlife behaviour and spark‑shifter swarms.
    
- **[[Elder Brinyar]]** #npc — A local elder of Magda. Together with Hemlock he assessed the party’s evidence and agreed to pay 25 gp per slain creature. The unexpected spider dragon necessitated further negotiations.
    
- **[[Farmer Tim]]** #npc — A farmer tending root drakes near Magda. He saw the battered party emerge from the cave and offered to fetch Hemlock. He mentioned that normally docile creatures have been agitated lately.
    
- **[[Borin Stonehelm]]** (“Scalehand”) #npc — The one‑armed dwarf proprietor of [[Dragon's Rest]]. He once belonged to a nomadic warrior tribe and lost his arm—and his tribe—fighting an ancient stone dragon. Borin listens keenly to travellers’ tales and rewards good stories with drinks like Emberfang Reserve. He is married to [[Evelyn Stonehelm]].
    
- **[[Evelyn Stonehelm]]** #npc — Borin’s wife and Dragon’s Rest’s cook. She wields a frying pan with surprising strength and declines Eldar’s drunken challenge for a cook‑off. Her cooking forms part of the tavern’s draw.
    
- **[[Derek]]** #Player_Character — A “Florida man”–like newcomer who wrestles drakes for sport. He overheard the party’s story at Dragon’s Rest and showed interest in joining their travels. His easy camaraderie and gator‑wrestling skills add levity to the group.
    
- **[[Glimmer Wings]]** #npc #monster — Mischievous fairy‑dragon creatures in Magda. They stole Lucky’s coins and replaced them with glowing “shimmer shrooms,” psychedelic mushrooms that allow one to see a person’s inner light. These shrooms are cultivated by glimmer wings and may be used to assess corruption or light within beings.

## ⚔️ Creatures Fought

- **[[Spider Dragon]]** #monster #combat — A juvenile hybrid of dragon and spider nesting in the Garden of Bones. It used webs and molten breath in a cramped cavern, forcing the party to fight carefully. Eldar harvested 20 lb of meat and some scales; the creature’s presence hints at broader dragon activity around the Enclave.
    
- **Mutated Spiders** #monster #combat — Several spiders in the Garden of Bones had been twisted by molten corruption and zenithite influence. They attacked the party before the spider dragon appeared; their bodies provided evidence for Hemlock’s bounty.
    
- **Rats and Mephits** #monster #combat — The caves contained smaller mutated creatures, including rats and a mephit hiding behind a stalactite. Although the mephit did not attack, its presence added tension to the descent.
    
- **Spark‑Shifters** #monster #lore — Swarms of tiny electric flies that gather into storm‑like clouds, causing lightning strikes. Local farmers report unusually large flights of spark‑shifters moving south. The party has not yet faced them but notes them as a future threat.
    
- **Root Drakes and Vine Drakes** #monster — Domesticated reptilian beasts used as beasts of burden around Magda. The party encountered them with Farmer Tim and later wrestled vine drakes during downtime, earning scales and gold.
    
- **Stoneback Borrower** #monster — A burly, armored drake that Derek wrestled for fun during downtime. Wrestling it earned him bruises and 25 gp worth of scales.

## ✨ Items & Rewards

- **[[Molten Hearthstone]]** #artifact #lore — A blazing orb dripping magma; source of molten corruption in the Garden of Bones. Contact with the Hearthstone inflicts fire damage and exhaustion but can grant boons from [[Ashqua]]. It radiates corruption until properly contained or destroyed. Eldar crafted a zenithite rod (roughly a wand) to handle it safely.
    
- **Zenithite Crystals** #loot — Blue crystals running through the islands that conduct light energy and interact with molten corruption. When pressed against the Hearthstone they absorb light and become warm. Eldar used a heated zenithite chunk to shape a handle for the Hearthstone.
    
- **Eldar’s Boon** #magicitem #charactergoal — As a result of his communion with [[Ashqua]], Eldar can now spend two light points to make a ranged unarmed strike (flurry‑like attack) up to 30 ft away. He also suffers one point of exhaustion from the ordeal.
    
- **Emberfang Reserve** #loot — A strong whiskey provided by [[Borin Stonehelm]]. Drinking a shot before combat requires a DC 12 Constitution save; success grants advantage on Intimidation checks for 10 minutes, but failure imposes disadvantage on Dexterity saves. It smells of smoked cherry wood and scorched cinnamon and tastes like burnt caramel.
    
- **Spider‑Dragon Meat** #loot — Eldar harvested about 20 lb of spider‑dragon meat and later smoked it using his culinary skills. Venom glands and nerves had to be removed carefully to avoid toxicity. The meat can feed the party or be sold.
    
- **Gold Reward** #loot — The party earned 2 550 gp from Hemlock for clearing spiders, rats and the unknown spider dragon. They set aside 1 000 gp as a party fund and split the rest (~221 gp per person). Additional gold was earned from farm work (10 gp) and drake‑wrestling (25 gp).
    
- **Uncommon Items** #magicitem — As part of the guild’s reward, each adventurer may request one uncommon magic item to be delivered in three days. Potential choices include a **[[Bag of Holding]]**, **Ring of Mind Shielding**, Clockwork Amulet, returning javelins, etc. These items represent a significant upgrade for the party.
    
- **Shimmer Shrooms** #loot #lore — Glowing orange mushrooms cultivated by glimmer wings. Eating one (DC 15 Con save) induces kaleidoscopic visions and allows the eater to see wisps of light around individuals, revealing their affinity to elements or corruption. Lucky obtained three; two were eaten, leaving one for future use.
    
- **Mushroom‑Bearing Quarterstaff** #artifact #charactergoal — Rex (a ranger/druid) is cultivating a new quarterstaff seeded with a mycelial network. Over time it may produce various fungi for spellcasting or Goodberry equivalents.

## 📜 Lore & Revelations

- **Moon‑Cult Burial Ground** #lore — The [[Garden of Bones]] is an ancient holy site of the Moon‑Cult. The bodies interred there pre‑date the Eclipse Wars, suggesting that Magda’s history is intertwined with older religions. The presence of molten corruption hints at a clash between lunar and solar forces.
    
- **Molten Corruption & Zenithite** #lore — Blue zenithite veins in the caverns carry “light” that, when distorted by the Hearthstone, corrupts creatures into molten forms. Without intervention the Garden’s spider dragon and spiders would have fully succumbed. Zenithite also responds to the Hearthstone’s light, heating and glowing when brought close.
    
- **[[Ashqua]]’s Message** #lore #questhook — Through the Hearthstone, [[Ashqua]] urged Eldar to cleanse rot and travel south to a hidden shrine where a statue holds a real sword. Her instructions imply that the Solar Faith maintains secret relics and that Eldar’s destiny is tied to the New Solar Republic at [[Ashqua Citadel]].
    
- **High Priestess Ayzat & Shrine** #lore #questhook — Ashqua revealed that High Priestess [[Ayzat]]’s shrine lies near [[Gazaleth]]. The statue of Ayzat’s consort grasps a weapon that is not stone but steel. Retrieving it could grant the party a divine weapon and deeper insight into the Solar faith.
    
- **Ancient Stone Dragon** #lore — Rumours at [[Dragon's Rest]] suggest that [[Borin Stonehelm]] lost his arm and his tribe fighting a colossal stone dragon that summoned rage from the skies. This creature might reside on an island north of Magda; its existence explains why animals are restless and may foreshadow a future epic confrontation. (inspiration for this dragon is meant to be Ancient Dragon Lansseax from Eldenring )
    
- **Spark‑Shifter Swarms** #lore — The party learned of spark‑shifters: swarms of electrical flies that can accumulate into storm‑clouds, raining lightning on the land. Unprecedented flights of these insects have been seen near Magda, hinting at environmental imbalance or a looming threat.
    
- **Shimmer Shrooms & Light Sight** #lore — The shimmer shrooms stolen by glimmer wings allow one to perceive the light (or elemental affinity) within creatures. Lucky saw Eldar wreathed in fire and Halar/Skarn surrounded by snow, indicating their primal connections. Such insight may help identify corrupted beings.
    
- **Unexpected Company** #lore — The adventurers chose the name “Unexpected Company” for their group, reflecting how their disparate backgrounds converged unexpectedly. This name will appear in guild records, spreading their fame.

## 🧵 Plot Threads & Player Goals

- **Investigate Animal Disturbances** #thread — Farmer [[Tim]] and other locals report docile animals becoming violent and spark‑shifter swarms migrating south. The party plans to uncover the cause of this ecological imbalance.
    
- **Retrieve the Solar Sword** #questhook — [[Ashqua]] instructed Eldar to find the hidden shrine of High Priestess [[Ashqua]] south of Magda and claim the real sword held by her statue. This quest promises a powerful weapon and deeper connection to the Solar faith.
    
- **Manage the Molten Hearthstone** #thread — Although Eldar gained a boon from the [[Molten Hearthstone]], the artifact continues to radiate corruption. The party must decide whether to destroy it, contain it permanently or use it cautiously. Prolonged exposure threatens to mutate anyone nearby.
    
- **Await Uncommon Rewards** #thread — The Stone‑Carvers Guild will deliver an uncommon magic item to each party member in three days. The party must stay in Magda or arrange for delivery; this downtime also allows for crafting, training or research.
    
- **Rumour of the Ancient Dragon** #thread — [[Borin Stonehelm]]’s story of a stone dragon that annihilated his tribe suggests a legendary beast on a northern island. Investigating this rumour could explain the unusual weather, spark‑shifters and animal migrations.
    
- **Shimmer Shrooms & Glimmer Wings** #thread — The party now knows of glimmer wings and their cultivated mushrooms. These creatures may hold secrets about light and corruption or serve as allies/enemies depending on how they are approached.
    
- **Party Funds & Trade** #thread — The party has established a 1 000 gp fund and a shared identity. They may invest in supplies, hire retainers, commission equipment (e.g., [[Bag of Holding]]), or donate to causes.
    
- **Character‑Specific Goals** #charactergoal
    
    - **Eldar** seeks to perfect his culinary arts (smoking spider‑dragon meat) and craft weapons worthy of [[Ashqua]]. He plans to acquire a ring of mind shielding to guard against further divine whispers.
        
    - **Rex** aims to cultivate a mushroom‑bearing quarterstaff and experiment with hallucinogenic fungi while tracking mushrooms like shimmer shrooms.

    - **Derek** enjoys wrestling drakes and may continue to challenge local beasts, earning gold and scales.
        
    - **Ben Ravencroft** hunts for knowledge to release his patron from a book and was disappointed by Magda’s poor arcane library; he will need to seek knowledge elsewhere.
        
    - **Halar & Skarn** (and other PCs) continue to explore their elemental affinities (snow and ice) and decide how to spend their uncommon item acquisitions.
