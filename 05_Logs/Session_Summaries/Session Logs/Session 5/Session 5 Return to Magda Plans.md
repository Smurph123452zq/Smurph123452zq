Session 5: Return to Magda

Current Situation
After retreating from the [[Garden of Bones Shrine]], the party emerges near [[Magda]]. Ashqua's scorching proclamation still rings in [[Eldar Grelamin]]'s ears, promising him fiery power. Meanwhile, fleeting silver shimmers remind [[Skarhn Runefall]] and [[Hallar]] that [[Nerrath]] watches with approval.

Session Goal
* Reorient in Magda and decide how to handle the corruption spreading from the shrine.
* Follow up on leads from the heartstone or consult allies about next steps.

Scene Breakdown
1. Ashqua's Vision (5–10 min)
   * Begin with Eldar hearing the words of [[Ashqua's Fiery Decree]]. Her voice judges him yet offers strength.
   * The boon lingers as warmth in his hands and a brand of light.
2. Return to Town (10–15 min)
   * The party climbs from the hidden tunnels back to Magda's streets.
   * Locals greet them oblivious to the shrine. Skarhn and Hallar catch hints of moonlit glow, subtle praise from [[Nerrath's Moonlit Favor]].
3. Debrief & Downtime (20–30 min)
   * Talk with townsfolk, restock supplies, and plan where to investigate next.
   * Ashqua's wrathful expectations drive Eldar, while the others feel Nerrath's quiet pride.
