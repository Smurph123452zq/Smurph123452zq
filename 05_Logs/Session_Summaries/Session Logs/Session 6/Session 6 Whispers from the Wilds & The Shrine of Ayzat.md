## Session 6: Whispers from the Wilds & The Shrine of Ayzat #session_plan #shatteredisles

### 1. Recap of Previous Session

The party (dubbed “[Unexpected Company](app://obsidian.md/Unexpected%20Company)”) returned from the eerie [Garden of Bones](app://obsidian.md/Garden%20of%20Bones) beneath [Magda](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FSetting%20%26%20Cosmology%2FGeography%2FGeala%C3%AD%20Enclave%2FIslands%2FCr%C3%ADoch%20Skolvar%2FTowns%2FMagda%2FMagda.md), having defeated a juvenile [Spider Dragon](app://obsidian.md/Spider%20Dragon) and encountered the divine power of [Ashqua](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FPantheon%20%26%20Deities%2FAshqua.md) through Monk [Eldar Grelamin](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FParty%2FPlayer%20Characters%2FEldar%20Grelamin.md). Eldar received a boon allowing ranged unarmed strikes, while also being tasked with finding the shrine of High Priestess [Ayzat](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FNPCs%2FAyzat.md). They learned that mutated creatures and erratic animal behavior are plaguing the Galali Enclave. The party divvied up 2550 gp and decided to investigate both the strange animal behavior _and_ seek out the shrine.

### 2. Narrative Goals for This Session

- **Investigate the source of the escalating unrest among wildlife:** Determine what is causing animals to become aggressive and spark-shifters to swarm south.
- **Locate the hidden shrine of High Priestess [Ayzat](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FNPCs%2FAyzat.md)**: Follow clues from [Ashqua](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FPantheon%20%26%20Deities%2FAshqua.md)’s message and navigate the terrain south of [Magda](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FSetting%20%26%20Cosmology%2FGeography%2FGeala%C3%AD%20Enclave%2FIslands%2FCr%C3%ADoch%20Skolvar%2FTowns%2FMagda%2FMagda.md).
- **Uncover initial lore about [Ayzat](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FNPCs%2FAyzat.md) and her connection to [Ashqua](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FPantheon%20%26%20Deities%2FAshqua.md):** Begin to understand the history behind these powerful figures.
- **Introduce a new threat/complication:** Hint at a larger, looming danger connected to the corrupted energies affecting the region.

### 3. Key Locations

- **[Magda](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FSetting%20%26%20Cosmology%2FGeography%2FGeala%C3%AD%20Enclave%2FIslands%2FCr%C3%ADoch%20Skolvar%2FTowns%2FMagda%2FMagda.md):** Starting point for the session; opportunity for final preparations and gathering information from NPCs.
- **The Whispering Woods:** A dense forest south of [Magda](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FWorld%20Overview%2FSetting%20%26%20Cosmology%2FGeography%2FGeala%C3%AD%20Enclave%2FIslands%2FCr%C3%ADoch%20Skolvar%2FTowns%2FMagda%2FMagda.md), known for its strange acoustics and unsettling atmosphere. This is where the initial investigation into animal behavior begins. [#forest](app://obsidian.md/index.html#forest) [#exploration](app://obsidian.md/index.html#exploration)
- **Gazaleth Outskirts:** Rugged, rocky terrain surrounding the rumored location of [Ayzat](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FNPCs%2FAyzat.md)’s shrine. Difficult to navigate, with hidden paths and potential dangers. [#terrain](app://obsidian.md/index.html#terrain) [#questlocation](app://obsidian.md/index.html#questlocation)
- **[Hidden Shrine of High Priestess Ayzat](app://obsidian.md/Hidden%20Shrine%20of%20High%20Priestess%20Ayzat):** A secluded shrine built into a cliff face, containing clues about [Ayzat](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FNPCs%2FAyzat.md)'s past and the events leading up to [The Eclipse Wars](obsidian://open?file=01_Worldbuilding%2FHistory%2FThe%20Eclipse%20Wars.md). [#shrine](app://obsidian.md/index.html#shrine) [#lore](app://obsidian.md/index.html#lore)

### 4. Encounter Ideas

- **Social: Gathering Information in Magda:** Begin at [Dragon’s Rest](app://obsidian.md/Dragon%E2%80%99s%20Rest), questioning [Borin Stonehelm](app://obsidian.md/Borin%20Stonehelm) and [Evelyn Stonehelm](app://obsidian.md/Evelyn%20Stonehelm) about recent animal behavior. Borin recalls increased aggression among the root drakes, while Evelyn mentions strange humming sounds coming from the woods. (DC 12 Charisma check to gain useful information).
- **Exploration: Investigating Disturbed Farms:** The party visits Farmer Tim’s farm, finding trampled crops and signs of panicked animals. A successful Wisdom (Survival) check reveals unusual tracks – not just animal prints, but also faint impressions resembling claw marks. [#exploration](app://obsidian.md/index.html#exploration) [#survival](app://obsidian.md/index.html#survival)
- **Combat: Corrupted Boars in the Whispering Woods:** Following the tracks leads to a clearing where three mutated boars attack. These boars exhibit glowing red eyes and emit a low growl. (CR 1/2 each; emphasize their aggressive behavior).
    - **Tactical Note**: Encourage players to use terrain to their advantage, given Hallar’s tanking ability and Derrik's stealth capabilities.
- **Social: Hermit’s Warning:** Deeper in the woods, the party encounters Old Man Hemlock (not the innkeeper), a reclusive hermit who warns them about the shrine being guarded by “spirits of regret” and that the land itself resists intrusion. He demands a rare herb as payment for information. [#social](app://obsidian.md/index.html#social) [#npc](app://obsidian.md/index.html#npc)
- **Exploration: Navigating Gazaleth:** The terrain becomes increasingly difficult, requiring successful Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks to traverse rocky cliffs and dense vegetation. A failed check results in minor injuries or delays.
- **Discovery: Shrine Entrance:** After overcoming the challenges of Gazaleth, the party discovers a hidden entrance to [Hidden Shrine of High Priestess Ayzat](app://obsidian.md/Hidden%20Shrine%20of%20High%20Priestess%20Ayzat), concealed behind a waterfall. [#discovery](app://obsidian.md/index.html#discovery)

### 5. Clues & Lore

- **Boar Mutations**: The mutated boars exhibit signs of exposure to corrupted energy – glowing eyes and aggressive behavior. This suggests a source of corruption within the woods.
- **Hermit’s Prophecy:** Old Man Hemlock speaks in riddles, hinting that the shrine is protected by spirits bound to regret and that disturbing it will awaken ancient powers.
- **Shrine Inscriptions**: The entrance to the shrine is inscribed with archaic runes detailing [Ayzat](obsidian://open?file=02_Characters%2FNPCs%2FAyzat.md)'s devotion to both sun and moon, suggesting a complex relationship with divine forces.

### 6. Player Character Hooks

- **Eldar Grelamin:** As the recipient of Ashqua’s boon, Eldar may experience unsettling visions or dreams related to the shrine and its history.
- **Lucky Folais:** Lucky's connection to nature allows him to sense the growing corruption within the woods, potentially leading to insights about its source.
- **Skarhn Runefall**: Skarhn’s past life may hold clues about the ancient rituals performed at the shrine and the forces that protect it.

### 7. Session End & Cliffhanger

The session ends with the party standing before the entrance to [Hidden Shrine of High Priestess Ayzat](app://obsidian.md/Hidden%20Shrine%20of%20High%20Priestess%20Ayzat). As they prepare to enter, a faint humming sound fills the air, and the ground beneath their feet begins to tremble. A distant roar echoes through the woods, hinting at a larger threat lurking nearby.
