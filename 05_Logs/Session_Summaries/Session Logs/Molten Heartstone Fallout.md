# Molten Heartstone Fallout

tags: GardenOfBones, Heartstone, Ashqua, Consequence

When the whispers from the molten heartstone charmed [[Skarhn]] and [[Hallar]], [[Eldar Grelamin]] seized the orb to keep them from touching it. Their allies helped them break free, denying the stone a sacrifice and unleashing dangerous repercussions:

- **Lingering Voices:** The charmed character continues to hear faint whispers for days, suffering disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws until cleansed.
- **Awakened Defenses:** The shrine shudders with molten energy, reanimating nearby [[Restless Khenra]] or conjuring a [[Molten Effigy]] unless the heartstone is sealed.
- **Ashqua's Attention:** Eldar's interference draws the gaze of [[Ashqua]], increasing the chance that her cultists or corrupted creatures target him in future scenes.
- **Nerrath's Gratitude:** Because Skarhn and Hallar resisted the corruption, the shrine briefly glowed with silver light. Each earned [[Nerrath's Moonlit Favor]].
- **Escalating Corruption:** Without a sacrifice to drain power, the heartstone bleeds unchecked. Wildlife around [[Magda]] warps faster, and locals whisper of haunting dreams and sudden flames.
