**Hullsplitter Velric**, as he’s known around the docks of [[Galazeth]], wasn't always a grizzled sky-shark hunter. Thirty years prior, he was a cartographer for the Dragon Harmony Collective, charting air currents and migratory routes of the docile dragon descendants used for transport. He left that life after witnessing firsthand how some unscrupulous merchants were exploiting the dragons, leading to several incidents of mistreatment. Velric vowed to protect the skies, shifting his focus to hunting sky-sharks – massive creatures that preyed on both travelers *and* the dragons, becoming a self-appointed guardian of the aerial routes. He funds his solitary work by selling shark hides and teeth, though he often gives away more than he keeps, particularly to those who show respect for the dragons.

His latest hunt began two weeks ago, tracking reports of an unusually aggressive sky-shark disrupting trade routes near the Azure Cliffs. Rumors spoke of a strange, blackening corruption spreading across its hide – whispers that were dismissed as sailor’s tales until Velric saw it himself. The creature wasn't just attacking ships; it was *changing*, radiating heat even from miles away. He pursued it in his airship, “The Windshear,” a sturdy vessel built with salvaged dragon bone and reinforced sails, hoping to end the threat before it reached [[Galazeth]]. He’d faced corrupted beasts before, remnants of [[Ashqua]]'s influence leaking into Magda, but nothing like this.

The encounter was a maelstrom of chaos. The air crackled with heat as the corrupted sky-shark, now visibly wreathed in black fire, slammed into The Windshear. Velric remembers the sickening crunch of dragon bone splintering, the smell of ozone and burning oil filling his lungs, and the terrifying shriek of the beast echoing across the clouds. He fought back with harpoons tipped with azurite – a mineral known to disrupt corrupted energies – but they barely seemed to slow it down. The shark’s hide felt…wrong, not scaled like a normal sky-shark, but slick and burning, radiating an unnatural heat that threatened to melt his ship around him. A final, devastating blow tore through the Windshear's engine, sending it spiraling downwards towards the jagged peaks below.

Velric barely survived, crash-landing in a remote ravine outside [[Galazeth]]. He’s now nursing broken ribs and a haunted look, recounting his tale to anyone who will listen. The wreckage of The Windshear is still smoldering, attracting scavengers and sparking rumors about a new breed of corrupted sky-sharks threatening the trade routes. He believes the creature was more than just corrupted; it felt *directed*, as if guided by something intelligent.

This could lead to several story hooks: players might be tasked with salvaging parts from The Windshear, investigating the source of the corruption (potentially linking back to [[Molten]] influence or a new cult), or even joining Velric on a renewed hunt for the creature, now believed to be heading towards [[First Light]]. Rumors in taverns could mention sightings of similar corrupted sharks, and merchants might offer rewards for information leading to their destruction. Velric himself could become a valuable source of information about sky-shark behavior and the dangers lurking beyond [[Galazeth]], offering guidance or even a modified harpoon blueprint as a reward for assistance.
