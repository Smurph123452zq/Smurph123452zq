Zakarath built his reputation without once leaving his warren. Using scrying and his eerily intelligent roach swarm, he gathered whispers from across the Shattered Isles and compiled them into the widely read [[Roach Report]]. Adventurers scoffed at the oddball hermit until his predictions of political upsets and monster sightings began coming true, earning him both gold and grudging respect.

## Quirks & Traits
- His cockroaches scuttle around delivering tiny scrolls and pilfered trinkets.
- Hoards every scrap of paper and gem shard, rarely spending his wealth.
- Comments bluntly on heroes' failures in his newsletter, citing them by name.

## Rumors & Hooks
- A forbidden draft of the [[Roach Report]] details a cult plot; recovering it could reveal dangerous secrets.
- Some roaches are rumored to carry coded messages between distant factions.
- Zakarath might pay handsomely for obscure gossip or relics that fuel his predictions.
- Rivals plot to expose his lair, forcing adventurers to help relocate his operation.
